# Development Roadmap

This page outlines the planned features and improvements for Esker. While we can't guarantee specific timelines, we want to share our vision for the future of the application. Your feedback helps us prioritize what to build next!

## How We Plan

Our development roadmap is guided by several principles:
- **User-driven development**: We prioritize features most requested by our community
- **Core experience first**: We focus on perfecting the writing experience before adding peripheral features
- **Incremental improvements**: We deliver frequent, smaller updates rather than infrequent major releases

## Current Focus Areas
