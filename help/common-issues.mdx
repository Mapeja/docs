This guide addresses the most common issues you might encounter while using Esker and provides straightforward solutions to get you back to writing quickly.

## Startup Issues

### Esker Won't Launch

If Esker fails to start:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check System Requirements">
    Verify your device meets the [minimum system requirements](/getting-started/installing#system-requirements).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Your Device">
    A simple restart can resolve many temporary system issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reinstall Esker">
    Uninstall Esker, download a fresh copy, and reinstall.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Error on Startup

If you see an error message when launching Esker:

1. Note the exact error message
2. Check if your operating system needs updates
3. Verify you have the latest version of Esker
4. Try launching with administrator privileges (Windows) or from Applications (Mac)

## File Management Issues

### Can't Save Files

If you're unable to save your work:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Permissions">
    Ensure you have write permissions for the location where you're trying to save.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try a Different Location">
    Attempt to save to a different folder, such as your Documents folder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Disk Space">
    Verify you have sufficient free space on your drive.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Save As">
    Try using "Save As" with a new filename instead of "Save".
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Can't Open Files

If you're unable to open an existing .esker file:

1. Verify the file exists and hasn't been moved or deleted
2. Check that the file isn't corrupted (try opening a different .esker file)
3. Ensure the file isn't being used by another application
4. Try using "Open Project" from the menu rather than double-clicking the file

### File Appears Empty

If your file opens but appears empty:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check File Size">
    Verify the file has a non-zero size in your file explorer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try Opening a Backup">
    Look for automatic backups of your file in the Esker backup folder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open with Text Editor">
    Try opening the .esker file with a plain text editor like Notepad to see if content is visible.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  If your file appears empty but has content when viewed in a text editor, do not save the empty version in Esker, as this could overwrite your content.
</Warning>

## Editor Issues

### Text Formatting Not Working

If formatting shortcuts or syntax aren't working as expected:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Syntax">
    Ensure you're using the correct syntax (e.g., `#` for headings, `=` for synopses).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position Check">
    Make sure special characters are at the beginning of a line, not preceded by any spaces.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Editor">
    Try saving your work, closing Esker, and reopening it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Cursor Jumping or Erratic Behavior

If your cursor jumps to unexpected locations while typing:

1. Check if you have conflicting keyboard shortcuts from other applications
2. Disable any browser extensions if using the web version
3. Make sure your input device (mouse/touchpad) is functioning properly
4. Try turning off Typewriter Mode if it's enabled

### Text Disappearing

If text seems to disappear when typing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Focus Mode">
    If Focus Mode is enabled, text outside your current paragraph will appear dimmed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Outline Mode">
    If Outline Mode is enabled, body text is hidden. Press F8 to exit Outline Mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Selection">
    You might be accidentally selecting and replacing text. Try clicking to place your cursor without dragging.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance Issues

### Slow Performance with Large Documents

If Esker becomes sluggish with large documents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Split Your Project">
    Consider dividing very large projects into multiple smaller files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close Other Applications">
    Free up system resources by closing other memory-intensive programs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable Features">
    Try turning off features like Focus Mode or Typewriter Mode temporarily.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Application Freezes

If Esker freezes or becomes unresponsive:

1. Wait a moment to see if it recovers (especially if you have a large document)
2. Try saving your work using Ctrl+S (Windows) or Cmd+S (Mac)
3. If unresponsive, force close the application and restart
4. Upon restarting, check for auto-recovered content

<Tip>
  Enable autosave in Options to minimize potential data loss if the application freezes.
</Tip>

## Feature-Specific Issues

### Sidebar Not Updating

If the sidebar doesn't reflect changes to your document structure:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Syntax">
    Ensure your headings, synopses, and notes use the correct prefix syntax.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manually Update">
    Try adding or modifying a heading to trigger a sidebar update.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Esker">
    Save your work, close Esker, and reopen your project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Focus Mode Problems

If Focus Mode isn't working properly:

1. Toggle Focus Mode off and on again (F10)
2. Try clicking directly in a paragraph to ensure it receives focus
3. If multiple paragraphs remain highlighted, save and restart Esker
4. Check if Zero Distractions Mode is interfering (F12 to toggle)

### Writing Sprint Issues

If you encounter problems with writing sprints:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Timer">
    Verify the timer is running by looking for the progress bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Word Count Recognition">
    Make sure new words are being counted by typing a few words and checking the count.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cancel and Restart">
    If a sprint seems stuck, try canceling and starting a new sprint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Export Problems

If you're having trouble exporting your document:

1. Try a different export format (TXT or MD are the most reliable)
2. Ensure you have sufficient disk space for the exported file
3. Check for special characters that might cause issues in exports
4. For PDF exports, make sure required dependencies are properly installed

    Request another magic link if the previous one has expired.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear Browser Data">
    Try clearing your browser cache and cookies if using the web version.

## Browser-Specific Issues (Web Version)

### Content Not Saving

If you're using the web version and content isn't saving:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Storage">
    Ensure your browser allows local storage and that you haven't exceeded limits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export Frequently">
    For the web version, export your work regularly as a backup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try Desktop Version">
    Consider switching to the desktop version for more reliable file handling.

4. Check if your browser has JavaScript enabled

## Recovery Strategies

### Recovering Lost Work

If you've lost work due to a crash or other issue:

  <Step title="Check Autosaves">
    Look for autosaved versions in the Esker backup folder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Temp Files">
    Search your system's temporary files folders for .esker files.
