# Creating Your First Project

This guide walks you through creating your first Esker project, from initial setup to saving your work.

## Creating a New Project

To create a new project in Esker:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Esker">
    Launch Esker on your computer. If this is your first time using the application, you'll be greeted with a splash screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a New Project">
    Click the **New Project** button on the splash screen. Alternatively, if you're already in Esker, click the menu button (☰) in the top-left corner and select **New Project**.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Project Details">
    In the New Project dialog, fill in:
    
    - **Author**: Your name
    - **Title**: The title of your project
    - **Subtitle** (optional): A subtitle for your project
    - **Series** (optional): If this is part of a series
    - **Contact Information** (optional): Your contact details
    
    ![Project Details Form](https://placeholder.img/projectdetails.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Template">
    Select a project template from the dropdown menu:
    
    - **Tutorial Project**: A guided example with instructions
    - **Blank Project**: Start with a clean slate
    - **Three-Act Structure**: Basic novel framework
    - **Hero's Journey**: Classic storytelling template
    - **Save The Cat Beat Sheet**: Screenwriting framework
    - **27 Chapter Outline**: Detailed novel structure
    - **Snowflake Method**: Iterative story development framework
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Goals (Optional)">
    If desired, set:
    
    - **Word Count Goal**: Target word count for your project
    - **Deadline Date**: When you aim to complete the project
    
    <Tip>
      Setting a word count goal and deadline enables Esker to calculate how many words per day you need to write to reach your goal on time.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your Project">
    Click the **Create Project** button to finalize your project setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Your Project">
    Choose a location on your computer to save your `.esker` file. Remember this location so you can find it later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Esker Interface

After creating your project, you'll see the main Esker interface:

![Esker Interface Annotated](https://placeholder.img/interface.png)

The interface consists of:

1. **Menu Button (☰)**: Access project settings, export options, and application features
2. **Sidebar**: Automatically displays your document structure as you write
3. **Editor**: The main writing area where you'll compose your content
4. **Statistics Bar**: Shows word count, reading time, and other metrics

## Starting to Write

To begin writing in your new project:

1. Click anywhere in the editor area to place your cursor
2. Start typing to add content
3. Use Esker's formatting syntax to structure your document:
   - `# Title` for main headings (chapters)
   - `## Subtitle` for subheadings (scenes)
   - `= Text` for synopses
   - `@ Text` for notes
   - `! Text` for bookmarks

As you write, the sidebar will automatically update to reflect your document structure.

<Tip>
  If you selected a template, you'll already have some structure in place. Feel free to modify or delete template content as needed.
</Tip>

## Saving Your Work

Esker automatically saves your work as you write, but you can also save manually:

- Click the menu button (☰) and select **Save** to save changes
- Use **Ctrl+S** (Windows) or **Cmd+S** (Mac) to save quickly
- Choose **Save As** from the menu to create a copy with a different name

Your work is saved as a `.esker` file that you can open later to continue writing.

## Project Settings

To access and update your project settings at any time:

1. Click the menu button (☰) in the top-left corner
2. Select **Project Settings**
3. Update details like your project title, word count goal, or deadline
4. Click **Save Settings** to apply your changes
