# What is Esker?

**Esker** is a distraction-free writing application designed to help you focus on your writing. Unlike traditional word processors, Esker is built specifically for writers who want to stay in the flow while organizing their thoughts.

## Core Philosophy

Esker is built on a simple premise: **writers need focus**. By combining a clean, distraction-free environment with powerful organization features, Esker helps you:

- **Stay in the writing flow** without switching between applications
- **Organize your thoughts** with an intuitive sidebar
- **Track your progress** with built-in writing statistics and goals

## How Esker Works

At its core, Esker is built around a **single-file approach** to writing. Your entire project—including chapters, scenes, notes, and more—lives in a single `.esker` file. This means:

- No need to manage multiple document files
- Easy organization within a single project
- Simple backup and version management

Esker uses a simple markdown-like syntax to distinguish between different types of content:

```
# Chapter Title        (creates a major heading)
## Scene Title         (creates a section heading)
= This is a synopsis   (adds a summary to a section)
@ This is a note       (adds a research note or comment)
```

As you write, Esker automatically builds a structured sidebar that makes navigation and organization intuitive.

## Who Esker Is For

Esker is ideal for:

- **Fiction writers** working on novels, short stories, or scripts
- **Non-fiction writers** organizing research and chapters
- **Anyone who values** a distraction-free writing environment

Whether you're writing your first novel or your tenth, Esker helps you focus on what matters: your words.
