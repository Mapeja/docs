# 📖 Understanding Esker’s Writing Format

Esker uses a **simple yet powerful syntax** to help writers structure their work efficiently. Whether you're drafting a novel, a screenplay, or research notes, Esker provides a streamlined approach to organization.

## ✍️ **Basic Formatting Elements**

Esker follows a **markup-style** format to differentiate between different types of content. Here’s a quick guide:

| Syntax | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `# Chapter Title` | Creates a **Heading 1** (Main Section) |
| `## Scene Title` | Creates a **Heading 2** (Subsection) |
| `### Sub-scene Title` | Creates a **Heading 3** (Detail) |
| `= Synopsis` | Adds a short summary below a heading |
| `@ Note` | Creates a **non-narrative note** |
| `! Bookmark` | Marks an **important reference point** |
| `Heading Text :: Sidebar Text` | Truncates sidebar display |

💡 **Tip:** You can mix and match these elements to create a **custom writing workflow** that suits your needs.

## 📝 **Using Headings to Structure Your Work**

Headings act as **major story beats or sections** in your manuscript. Use different heading levels to create a structured hierarchy:

```md
# Act One
## Scene One
### Scene Detail
```

🔹 **Headings automatically appear in the Sidebar**, making it easy to navigate your document.

## 📌 **Adding Synopses & Notes**

### **Synopses (`=`)**

A synopsis helps you summarize a section without adding it to the main manuscript:

```md
# Chapter One
= This chapter introduces the protagonist and conflict.
```

🔹 **Synopses appear in the Sidebar** under their respective headings for quick reference.

### **Notes (`@`)**

Notes are useful for **character details, research, or reminders**:

```md
@ The antagonist's motivation should be revealed in Act Two.
```

🔹 **Notes are excluded from export formats unless specified.**

## 🔖 **Using Bookmarks for Quick Navigation**

Bookmarks (`!`) allow you to mark key points:

```md
! Reveal of the hidden letter.
```

🔹 **Bookmarks appear in the Sidebar** for quick access.
