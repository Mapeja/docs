# 💾 Saving & Autosave

Esker ensures that your work is **always safe** by offering both **manual saving** and **autosave** options. This guide covers how Esker handles saving and best practices to avoid data loss.

## 📝 **Manual Saving**

Esker allows you to manually save your work whenever needed:

- Click **☰ Menu** → **Save**.
- Use the shortcut **Ctrl + S** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + S** (Mac).
- To create a backup copy, use **☰ Menu** → **Save As** and choose a new filename.

💡 **Tip:** Esker projects are stored as `.esker` files, keeping all your manuscript, notes, and settings in a single file.

## 🔄 **Autosave Feature**

By default, Esker **automatically saves your work** every few minutes to prevent data loss. You can customize this in the settings:

1. Click **☰ Menu** → **Options**.
2. Locate the **Autosave Settings** section.
3. Enable **Autosave** and set your preferred **time interval** (e.g., every 5 minutes).

### 📂 **Where Does Autosave Store Data?**

Autosaved files overwrite the existing `.esker` file. If a save fails, Esker attempts to create a temporary **recovery file**.

## 🛠 **Recovering Lost Work**

If Esker crashes or your file becomes corrupted, you can recover your work:

### **Check for Backup Files**
1. Navigate to your **Esker project folder**.
2. Look for a file named **`[YourProject]_backup.esker`**.
3. Open it in Esker.

### **Fallback Autosave Recovery**
1. Open **Esker**.
2. If an autosave is detected, you’ll see an **autosave recovery prompt**.
3. Click **Restore** to load the last autosaved version.

## 🗑️ **Preventing Accidental Data Loss**
- Always **Save Before Closing** Esker.
- **Enable Autosave** for extra security.
- Regularly **back up your `.esker` file** to a cloud service or external drive.
