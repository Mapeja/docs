# 📂 Creating and Managing Projects

Esker keeps all your writing in **one structured file**, making it easy to organize and manage your projects efficiently. This guide will walk you through creating, opening, and managing projects in Esker.

## 🆕 **Creating a New Project**

To start writing in Esker, create a new project:

1. Click **☰ Menu** → **New Project**.
2. Enter your **Project Name** and **Author Name**.
3. Set an optional **Word Count Goal** and **Deadline**.
4. Choose a **Project Template**:
   - 📝 **Blank Project** – Start fresh with no predefined structure.
   - 🎭 **Three-Act Structure** – Ideal for novelists.
   - 🌍 **Hero’s Journey** – A storytelling classic.
   - 🎬 **Save The Cat Beat Sheet** – Great for screenwriters.
5. Click **Create** and select a location to save your Esker project file (`.esker`).

💡 **Tip:** Esker uses a single `.esker` file format, allowing easy backups and portability.

## 📂 **Opening an Existing Project**

To continue working on an existing project:

1. Click **☰ Menu** → **Open Project**.
2. Select your `.esker` file from your computer.
3. Esker will load your document, notes, and settings instantly.

📌 **Recent Projects:** Esker remembers your recent projects, allowing quick access via **☰ Menu → Recent Projects**.

## 🔄 **Managing Projects**

### **Saving Your Work**
Esker **automatically saves your progress**, but you can also save manually:

- Click **☰ Menu** → **Save** (or use `Ctrl + S` / `Cmd + S`).
- Use **Save As** to create a backup copy of your project.
- Enable **Autosave** in settings to ensure frequent saves.

### **Renaming Your Project**
To rename your project:
1. Open the project settings by clicking **☰ Menu → Project Settings**.
2. Edit the **Project Name** field.
3. Click **Save Settings**.

### **Deleting a Project**
Since Esker stores files locally, deleting a project requires manual removal:
1. Locate the `.esker` file on your computer.
2. Move it to the **Trash** or **Recycle Bin**.

⚠️ **Warning:** Deleting an `.esker` file is permanent unless you have a backup.
