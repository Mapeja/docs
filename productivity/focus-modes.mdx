# Focus Modes

Esker offers several powerful focus modes designed to help you concentrate on your writing by eliminating distractions. Whether you prefer subtle assistance or complete immersion, there's a focus mode to suit your needs.

## Understanding Focus Modes

Focus modes help writers maintain concentration by:

- Reducing visual distractions
- Creating a clearer writing environment
- Highlighting only what's relevant to your current task
- Minimizing the temptation to edit rather than write

Esker provides four distinct focus enhancement tools, each offering different levels of distraction reduction:

1. **Focus Mode**: Highlights only your current paragraph
2. **Typewriter Mode**: Keeps your typing position centered on screen
3. **Zero Distractions Mode**: Combines multiple focus features for maximum concentration
4. **Outline Mode**: Provides a structural view of your document

## Focus Mode

Focus Mode dims everything except the paragraph you're currently editing, helping you concentrate on the immediate text.

### Enabling Focus Mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Focus Mode">
    Click the menu button (☰) and select **Enable Focus Mode**.
    
    Alternatively, press **F10** on your keyboard for quick access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Begin Writing">
    The paragraph you're currently editing will be highlighted, while the rest of the document is dimmed.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Focus Mode Works

When Focus Mode is active:

- The paragraph you're currently editing is displayed at normal brightness
- All other paragraphs are dimmed to reduce distraction
- The highlighting follows your cursor as you move between paragraphs
- You can still see your entire document, but attention is drawn to your active paragraph

<Tip>
  Focus Mode is particularly helpful for writers who tend to get distracted by their earlier text and fall into the trap of constant editing instead of moving forward.
</Tip>

## Typewriter Mode

Typewriter Mode keeps your current typing position vertically centered on the screen, mimicking the experience of using a physical typewriter.

### Enabling Typewriter Mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Typewriter Mode">
    Click the menu button (☰) and select **Enable Typewriter Mode**.
    
    Alternatively, press **F9** on your keyboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Typing">
    As you type, your cursor will remain in the vertical center of the screen, with text scrolling upward as you continue.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Typewriter Mode Works

When Typewriter Mode is active:

- Your cursor line stays fixed at the middle of the editor
- Previous text scrolls upward as you type new content
- You maintain an optimal viewing position without manual scrolling
- The writing experience becomes more comfortable for extended sessions

<Tip>
  Typewriter Mode is especially helpful for longer writing sessions as it reduces neck strain by keeping your gaze at a consistent level.
</Tip>

## Zero Distractions Mode

Zero Distractions Mode combines multiple focus features for the most immersive writing experience possible.

### Enabling Zero Distractions Mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Zero Distractions Mode">
    Click the menu button (☰) and select **Enable Zero Distractions Mode**.
    
    Alternatively, press **F12** on your keyboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Writing">
    Your screen will transform into a minimal writing environment with all unnecessary elements hidden.

## Outline Mode

    Click the menu button (☰) and select **Enable Outline Mode**.

    Your document will transform to show only headings, synopses, notes, and bookmarks, with body text condensed into word count indicators.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Outline Mode Works

When Outline Mode is active:

- Headings, synopses, notes, and bookmarks remain visible
- Body text is replaced with word count indicators showing how many words are hidden
- You can drag elements to reorganize your document structure
- You get a comprehensive overview of your document's organization

</Steps>

## Tips for Maximizing Focus

### Environment Setup

Beyond Esker's focus modes, consider your physical environment:

- Use headphones with ambient noise or instrumental music
- Ensure proper lighting to reduce eye strain
- Keep your writing space clean and organized
- Consider using a "do not disturb" sign or signal for others

### Typing Sounds

Esker's typing sounds can enhance focus for some writers:

1. Open Options (Menu → Options)
2. Select your preferred typing sound from the dropdown
3. Typing sounds provide audio feedback that can help maintain a rhythm

### Focus Sessions

Incorporate focus techniques into your writing sessions:

1. Start with a 5-minute warm-up in Zero Distractions Mode
2. Set a specific goal for your focused writing period
3. Take short breaks between focused sessions
4. Gradually increase your focused writing time

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Focus Mode not highlighting correctly | Try clicking directly in the paragraph you want to focus on |
| Typewriter Mode jumps unexpectedly | Avoid rapid cursor movements; move more deliberately between sections |
| Can't exit Zero Distractions Mode | Press F12 again, or use Esc to exit fullscreen first |
| Outline Mode not showing all elements | Make sure your elements use the correct syntax (# for headings, = for synopses, etc.) |
