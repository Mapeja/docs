# Word Count

Esker provides comprehensive word count features to help you track your writing progress, set goals, and maintain motivation throughout your writing journey.

## Word Count Display

The word count display appears in the statistics bar at the bottom of the screen:

![Word Count Display](https://placeholder.img/word-count.png)

The display shows:

- **Total**: The total number of words in your entire document
- **Narrative**: The number of words in narrative sections only (headings and body text)
- **Reading Time**: Estimated time it would take to read your document

<Tip>
  Narrative word count excludes notes (@) and synopses (=), focusing only on the actual content of your story or document.
</Tip>

## Setting a Word Count Goal

When starting a new project or editing project settings, you can set a word count goal:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Settings">
    Click the menu button (☰) and select **Project Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Word Count Goal">
    Enter your target word count in the **Word Count Goal** field.
    
    ![Word Count Goal Setting](https://placeholder.img/word-count-goal.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optionally Set a Deadline">
    If you want, set a **Deadline Date** to have Esker calculate how many words you need to write per day.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Settings">
    Click **Save Settings** to apply your changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once set, your narrative word count will display as a progress indicator (e.g., "Narrative: 12,345/50,000").

## Understanding Different Word Counts

Esker tracks different types of word counts to give you a complete picture of your project:

### Total vs. Narrative Count

- **Total Word Count**: Includes every word in your document
- **Narrative Word Count**: Includes only content that would appear in your final published work

The distinction is important because notes, synopses, and other planning elements can make up a significant portion of your document but won't be part of your finished work.

### Word Counting Rules

Esker counts words using the following rules:

- Words are defined as groups of characters separated by spaces
- Headings (# ## ###) are included in the narrative count
- Synopses (= ) and notes (@ ) are excluded from the narrative count
- Bookmarks (! ) are excluded from the narrative count
- Empty lines are not counted

## Tracking Progress Toward Goals

When you set a word count goal, Esker helps you track your progress in several ways:

### Visual Progress

The narrative word count display shows your current progress toward your goal:

```
Narrative: 12,345/50,000
```

This gives you an immediate sense of how far you've come and how far you have to go.

### Deadline Calculation

If you've set both a word count goal and a deadline, Esker will calculate the number of words you need to write each day to reach your goal on time.

This calculation appears in the Project Settings dialog when you review your goal and deadline.

<Tip>
  If your deadline feels overwhelming, try adjusting either the deadline date or the word count goal until the daily word count feels achievable.
</Tip>

## Reading Time Estimation

Esker automatically calculates an estimated reading time for your document, displayed in the statistics bar. This feature is useful for:

- Authors planning short stories with specific reading time targets
- Content creators optimizing for reader engagement
- Speakers preparing presentations or speeches

Reading time is calculated based on an average reading speed of 225 words per minute, which is typical for adult readers.

## Using Word Count for Productivity

Beyond simple tracking, you can use Esker's word count features to enhance your productivity:

### Setting Daily Targets

Using your project goal and deadline:

1. Check how many words per day Esker recommends
2. Use writing sprints or sessions to meet or exceed this daily target
3. Track your consistency over time

### Section Analysis

For longer works, check word counts of specific sections:

1. Use Outline Mode (F8) to see word counts for each section
2. Identify sections that need expansion or reduction
3. Balance your document by adjusting section lengths

## Advanced Word Count Techniques

### Template Word Counts

If you're writing to a specific format (like a novel genre, academic paper, or blog post), you might have target word counts for different sections:

| Section | Target Range |
|---------|--------------|
| Introduction | 500-750 words |
| Chapter | 2,000-3,000 words |
| Scene | 750-1,500 words |

Use Outline Mode to compare your actual section word counts against these targets.

### Word Count Milestones

Set milestone celebrations for yourself:

- Every 5,000 words: Take a short break
- Every 10,000 words: Reward yourself with something small
- Every 25,000 words: Take a day off or indulge in a larger reward

Celebrating milestones can help maintain motivation for longer projects.

### Targeted Writing Sessions

Use word count for focused writing sessions:

1. Identify your average words-per-minute from previous sessions
2. Multiply by your available time to set a realistic target
3. Use a writing sprint with this word count goal
4. Track your success rate to refine future targets

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Word count seems incorrect | Check if you have hidden text or embedded content that might affect the count |
| Narrative count includes notes | Make sure notes begin with the @ character |
| Goal progress not updating | Ensure you've saved your project settings with a word count goal |
| Word count not updating | Make sure the statistics bar is visible (Menu → Show Statistics) |
