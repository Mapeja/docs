# Writing Sprints

Writing Sprints are one of Esker's most powerful productivity features, helping you write more in less time by setting focused goals with clear endpoints. This guide explains how to use Writing Sprints effectively.

## What are Writing Sprints?

A Writing Sprint is a focused writing session with a specific goal:

- **Time-based Sprint**: Write for a set amount of time (e.g., 25 minutes)
- **Word Count Sprint**: Write until you reach a target word count (e.g., 500 words)

During a sprint, Esker tracks your progress and provides visual feedback, helping you stay motivated and focused.

## Starting a Writing Sprint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Sprint Setup">
    Click the **Writing Sprint** button in the bottom toolbar.
    
    ![Writing Sprint Button](https://placeholder.img/sprint-button.png)
    
    Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut **Alt+P** (Windows/Linux) or **Option+P** (Mac).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Sprint Type">
    In the Writing Sprint Setup dialog, select either:
    - **Time Sprint**: To write for a specific duration
    - **Word Count Sprint**: To write until reaching a word goal
    
    ![Sprint Type Selection](https://placeholder.img/sprint-type.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Your Goal">
    Depending on your selection:
    - For **Time Sprint**: Enter the number of minutes (e.g., 25)
    - For **Word Count Sprint**: Enter the target number of words (e.g., 500)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Options">
    Customize your sprint with these optional settings:
    
    - **Only count narrative words**: When checked, only counts words in body text and headings (excludes notes)
    - **Sound chime with sprint completion**: Plays a sound when the sprint ends
    - **Automatically show results after sprint**: Opens the results screen when done
    - **Enable Hemingway Mode**: Disables the backspace/delete key during your sprint
    
    ![Sprint Options](https://placeholder.img/sprint-options.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Sprinting">
    Click the **Start Sprint** button to begin writing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once the sprint starts, the **Writing Sprint** button will be replaced with a progress indicator showing your remaining time or words.

## Understanding Sprint Modes

### Time-Based Sprints

In a time-based sprint:
- The timer counts down from your set duration
- A progress bar fills as time passes
- You can write as much or as little as you want
- The sprint ends when the timer reaches zero

Time-based sprints are great for:
- Building a consistent writing habit
- Overcoming writer's block
- Working within a limited time window

### Word Count Sprints

In a word count sprint:
- The counter tracks your progress toward your goal
- The progress bar fills as you approach your target
- The sprint continues until you reach your word count goal
- There's no time limit

Word count sprints are ideal for:
- Completing specific sections of your project
- Meeting daily writing goals
- Pushing yourself to write more

## Tracking Your Progress

During a sprint, Esker provides real-time feedback:

- **Progress Bar**: Shows your progress visually at the top of the editor
- **Status Text**: Displays remaining time or words in the status area
- **Word Count**: Updates in real-time as you write

This instant feedback helps keep you motivated and on track to meet your goal.

## Hemingway Mode (Hardcore Mode)

Hemingway Mode, named after Ernest Hemingway's "write drunk, edit sober" philosophy, is a special challenge that disables the backspace and delete keys during your sprint.

This forces you to:
- Keep moving forward instead of editing
- Focus on getting words down, not perfecting them
- Break through perfectionism and self-criticism

<Tip>
  Hemingway Mode can be particularly effective for overcoming writer's block. By removing the ability to self-edit, you're forced to keep moving forward.
</Tip>

## Sprint Results

When your sprint ends, Esker provides a detailed summary of your performance:

![Sprint Results Screen](https://placeholder.img/sprint-results.png)

The results screen shows:
- **Words Written**: How many words you wrote during the sprint
- **Words Per Minute**: Your writing speed
- **Time Taken**: How long you spent writing (for word count sprints)

If you continue writing after your sprint ends, Esker will track this as "extra" time and words, showing how you performed after the pressure was off.

### Using Sprint Results

After reviewing your results, you can:
- **Start New Sprint**: Begin a fresh sprint with new settings
- **Repeat Sprint**: Start another sprint with the same settings
- **End Sprint**: Return to normal writing mode

## Sprint Strategies for Different Writers

### For Plotters (Outline-First Writers)

If you prefer planning before writing:
1. Use Outline Mode to plan your scenes
2. Set up multiple short time-based sprints (15-20 minutes each)
3. Focus each sprint on completing one scene or section
4. Take short breaks between sprints to review and adjust your outline

### For Pantsers (Discovery Writers)

If you prefer figuring out the story as you write:
1. Set up longer word count sprints (750-1000 words)
2. Use Hemingway Mode to prevent self-editing
3. Focus on moving the story forward without second-guessing
4. Review what you've written after the sprint ends

### For Procrastinators

If you struggle with getting started:
1. Set up very short time-based sprints (5-10 minutes)
2. Turn on all notifications (sound, results)
3. Tell yourself "I only need to write for 5 minutes"
4. Chain multiple short sprints together as momentum builds

## Building a Writing Habit with Sprints

To develop a consistent writing practice:

1. **Start small**: 10-15 minute sprints to build confidence
2. **Schedule sprint sessions**: Same time each day builds routine
3. **Track your results**: Note your daily/weekly word counts
4. **Gradually increase**: Add 5 minutes or 100 words each week
5. **Celebrate milestones**: Acknowledge your progress

<Tip>
  The key to building a habit is consistency, not intensity. A daily 15-minute sprint is more effective than an occasional 3-hour marathon.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Sprint doesn't start | Make sure you've selected a type and entered a valid number |
| Word count not increasing | Check if "Only count narrative words" is enabled while writing notes |
| Can't use backspace | This is intentional in Hemingway Mode; disable it in sprint options if needed |
| Sprint ends immediately | Ensure your word count goal isn't less than your current count |
