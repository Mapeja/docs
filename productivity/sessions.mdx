# Writing Sessions

Esker's session tracking feature helps you monitor your writing productivity over time. Unlike writing sprints, which focus on short bursts of intense writing, sessions are designed for tracking longer writing periods, making them perfect for your regular writing schedule.

## What Are Writing Sessions?

Writing sessions in Esker allow you to:

- Track how long you've been writing
- Count words written during your session
- Calculate your writing speed (words per minute)
- Monitor your productivity across multiple writing periods

Sessions are particularly useful for writers who want to establish consistent writing habits and understand their typical productivity patterns.

## Starting a Session

To begin tracking a writing session:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Session Controls">
    Find the session controls in the statistics bar at the bottom of the editor.
    
    ![Session Controls](https://placeholder.img/session-controls.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Your Session">
    Click the **Start Session** button to begin tracking.
    
    When active, Esker will start counting both your writing time and words written.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Starting a session only tracks new words written after the session begins. It won't count words already in your document.
</Note>

## Understanding Session Statistics

Once your session is active, Esker displays real-time statistics:

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Session Time | The total active writing time in hours, minutes, and seconds |
| Word Count | The number of words written during this session |
| Words Per Minute | Your average writing speed during the session |

The session timer and word counter give you immediate feedback on your productivity, helping you stay motivated and focused.

## Pausing and Resuming Sessions

Need to take a break? You can pause your session:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pause Your Session">
    Click the **Pause** button when you need to step away.
    
    The timer will stop, but your current word count will be preserved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resume When Ready">
    When you're ready to continue, click the **Resume** button.
    
    Esker will continue tracking from where you left off.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Pausing ensures that your average words-per-minute calculation remains accurate by excluding time when you weren't actively writing.

## Resetting a Session

When you want to start fresh:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Reset">
    Click the **Reset** button to clear your current session data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Reset">
    Your session statistics will be reset to zero, allowing you to start a new tracking period.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Resetting a session clears all current session data. This action cannot be undone, so consider recording important statistics elsewhere if you want to keep them.
</Warning>

## Session vs. Sprint: When to Use Each

Esker offers both sessions and sprints to accommodate different writing approaches:

| Feature | Sessions | Sprints |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Duration | Open-ended, for regular writing | Fixed time or word count |
| Purpose | Track regular productivity | Boost focused intensity |
| Feedback | Passive tracking | Active goal-pursuit |
| Best for | Daily writing routine | Breaking through blocks |

Consider using **sessions** for your everyday writing to track overall productivity, and **sprints** when you need motivation to reach a specific target.

## Tips for Effective Sessions

### Setting a Routine

Sessions are most effective when used consistently:

- Try to write at the same time each day
- Start a session at the beginning of each writing period
- Compare session statistics over time to identify your peak productivity hours

### Combining with Other Features

Enhance your sessions with other Esker features:

- Use **Focus Mode** (F10) during sessions to limit distractions
- Try **Typewriter Mode** (F9) to keep your text centered on screen
- Enable **Zero Distractions Mode** (F12) for maximum focus during important sessions

### Analyzing Your Data

Pay attention to your session data to optimize your writing process:

- Notice if your words-per-minute rate is higher at certain times of day
- Track how different environments affect your session productivity
- Use session data to set realistic goals for future writing projects

## Advanced Session Techniques

### Session Targets

While sessions don't have built-in targets like sprints, you can create your own:

1. Decide on a time target (e.g., "write for 2 hours") or word count target (e.g., "write 1,000 words")
2. Start a session
3. Write until you reach your personal target
4. Pause or reset the session when complete

### Daily Session Accountability

Create a simple writing log to track your sessions over time:

| Date | Session Duration | Words Written | WPM |
|------|------------------|---------------|-----|
| May 1 | 1h 35m | 876 | 9.2 |
| May 2 | 2h 10m | 1,254 | 9.7 |

Reviewing this data weekly can help you identify trends and set realistic writing goals.

### Micro-Sessions

For busy schedules, try using multiple short sessions throughout the day:

1. Start a session whenever you have a free moment
2. Write as much as you can
3. Pause when interruptions occur
4. Resume when you return
5. Check your total at the end of the day

This technique can help you make progress even on busy days with frequent interruptions.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Session not counting new words | Make sure you're modifying the document and not just moving the cursor |
| Timer seems inaccurate | Check that you've properly paused the session during breaks |
| Session data disappeared | Sessions reset when you close Esker; record important statistics externally |
| Can't find the session controls | Make sure the statistics bar is visible (Menu â†’ Show Statistics) |
