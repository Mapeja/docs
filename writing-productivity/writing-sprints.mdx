# 🏃 Using Writing Sprints  

**Writing Sprints** in Esker help you write **faster and more consistently** by setting a **time-based or word-based challenge**. Whether you're aiming for daily word goals or just trying to beat procrastination, Writing Sprints keep you on track.  

## 🎯 **Starting a Writing Sprint**  

To begin a sprint:  

1. Click **☰ Menu** → **Writing Sprint**.  
2. Choose your sprint type:  
   - **Time Sprint** – Write for a set time (e.g., 15 minutes).  
   - **Word Sprint** – Set a target word count (e.g., 500 words).  
3. Configure additional options:  
   - **Only count narrative words** (excludes notes & bookmarks).  
   - **Enable a sound chime** when the sprint ends.  
   - **Hardcore Mode (Hemingway Mode)** – Prevents deleting text while sprinting.  
4. Click **Start Sprint** and begin writing!  

💡 **Tip:** Esker visually tracks your progress in a **live sprint bar** at the top of the editor.  

## ⏳ **Tracking Sprint Progress**  

During your sprint, Esker will:  

✅ **Show a countdown timer** (for timed sprints).  
✅ **Track word count in real-time**.  
✅ **Visually indicate progress** in the sprint bar.  

If you hit your goal before time runs out, you can either **end the sprint early** or **keep going**!  

## 🏆 **Post-Sprint Results**  

After finishing a sprint, Esker provides **detailed results**:  

📊 **Words Written** – Total words added during the sprint.  
📈 **Words Per Minute (WPM)** – Your writing speed.  
🔄 **Compare to previous sprints** to track improvement.  

### 🔁 **Repeat or Start a New Sprint**  

At the end of a sprint, you can:  

- **Start Another Sprint** – Continue your writing streak.  
- **Repeat the Last Sprint** – Reuse the same settings.  
- **Exit & Save** – Your progress is automatically saved.  

## 🔥 **Hardcore Mode (Hemingway Mode)**  

For an added challenge, **Hardcore Mode**:  

🚫 **Disables the Backspace/Delete keys** – Forces forward momentum.  
✍️ **Prevents editing previous text** until the sprint ends.  
💡 **Great for beating perfectionism and writer’s block!**
