# 📊 Word Count & Statistics  

Esker provides **real-time writing analytics** to help you stay on track with your writing goals. With features like **live word count, reading time estimates, and progress tracking**, Esker makes it easy to measure your success.

## 🔢 **Tracking Word Count**  

The **word counter** is displayed in the bottom right of the editor and updates **as you type**. It includes:  

✅ **Total Word Count** – The number of words in your entire document.  
✅ **Narrative Word Count** – Excludes notes, bookmarks, and other non-narrative elements.  
✅ **Session Word Count** – Tracks how many words you’ve written during the current session.  

💡 **Tip:** Narrative Word Count is useful for tracking progress toward your **manuscript goal** while ignoring notes and metadata.

## 📖 **Reading Time Estimation**  

Want to know how long your draft takes to read? Esker estimates reading time based on:  

📚 **Average Reading Speed** – 225 words per minute (default).  
⚙️ **Customizable in Settings** – Adjust for different reading paces.  

The estimated **Reading Time** is displayed below the word counter.

## 🎯 **Setting Writing Goals**  

You can set a **Word Count Goal** for your project:  

1. Click **☰ Menu** → **Project Settings**.  
2. Enter your **target word count** (e.g., 80,000 words for a novel).  
3. (Optional) Set a **deadline** to calculate daily writing targets.
