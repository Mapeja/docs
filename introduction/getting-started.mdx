# 🚀 Getting Started with Esker

Welcome to **Esker**, your distraction-free writing companion! Follow this guide to set up Esker and start your first writing project in just a few minutes.

## 📥 **Installing Esker** *(If applicable)*
Esker runs locally on your device, meaning your work is stored **securely on your machine**. If you're using the desktop version, follow these steps:

1. **Download Esker** from the [official website](https://esker.app/download).
2. **Install the application** by following the instructions for your OS.
3. **Launch Esker** and get ready to write!

_No installation required for the web version—just open [Esker](https://esker.app) in your browser._

## 📂 **Creating a New Project**
Every story begins with a blank page. Here’s how to start your first project:

1. Click on **☰ Menu** → **New Project**.
2. Enter your **Project Name**, **Author Name**, and optional **Word Count Goal**.
3. Choose a **Project Template**:
   - ✨ **Blank Project** – Start from scratch.
   - 📖 **Three-Act Structure** – For well-structured narratives.
   - 🌀 **Hero’s Journey** – A storytelling classic.
   - ✍️ **Save The Cat Beat Sheet** – For screenwriters and novelists.
4. Click **Create** and choose where to save your Esker project file (`.esker`).

🎯 **Tip:** Esker projects are saved as `.esker` files, allowing easy backup and portability.

## ✍️ **Understanding Esker’s Writing Format**
Esker uses a **simple, intuitive syntax** to organize your writing. Here’s a quick reference:

| Syntax | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `# Chapter Title` | Creates a **Heading 1** (Main Section) |
| `## Scene Title` | Creates a **Heading 2** (Subsection) |
| `### Sub-scene Title` | Creates a **Heading 3** (Detail) |
| `= Synopsis` | Adds a short summary below a heading |
| `@ Note` | Creates a non-narrative note |
| `! Bookmark` | Marks an important point |
| `Heading Text :: Sidebar Text` | Truncates sidebar display |

🎯 **Tip:** Use **Outline Mode** to view and organize your story structure effortlessly.

## 💾 **Saving & Autosave**
Esker **automatically saves your progress**, but you can also manually save:

- Click **☰ Menu** → **Save** *(or use Ctrl + S / Cmd + S)*.
- Enable **Autosave** in settings to save every few minutes.
- Esker keeps **backup versions** to prevent data loss.

🛠 **Troubleshooting:** If Esker won’t open your `.esker` file, check if the file was moved or renamed incorrectly.
