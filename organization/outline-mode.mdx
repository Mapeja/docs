# Outline Mode

Outline Mode is a specialized view in Esker that helps you focus on your document's structure instead of its content. It's perfect for planning, reorganizing, and getting a bird's eye view of your project.

## What is Outline Mode?

Outline Mode condenses your document to show only structural elements (headings, synopses, notes, and bookmarks) while hiding body text. This gives you:

- A clear view of your document's overall structure
- Easy access to key points without scrolling through content
- A simplified interface for reorganizing sections

## Enabling Outline Mode

To activate Outline Mode:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Menu">
    Click the menu button (☰) in the top-left corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Outline Mode">
    Click **Enable Outline Mode** in the dropdown menu.
    
    Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut **F8**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

When Outline Mode is active, you'll notice:

- Regular body text is hidden
- Only headings, synopses, notes, and bookmarks remain visible
- Each visible element has a drag handle for reordering

## Navigating in Outline Mode

Outline Mode maintains the same navigation capabilities as the regular editor:

- **Scroll** through your document structure
- **Click** on any element to select it
- **Use arrow keys** to move between elements
- **Use the sidebar** for quick navigation between sections

The difference is that you're navigating through a condensed version of your document focused on structure rather than content.

## Understanding the Outline Display

In Outline Mode, different types of content are displayed as follows:

| Content Type | Display in Outline Mode |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Level 1 Headings (#) | Fully visible |
| Level 2 Headings (##) | Fully visible |
| Level 3 Headings (###) | Fully visible |
| Synopses (=) | Fully visible |
| Notes (@) | Visible (can be hidden in options) |
| Bookmarks (!) | Visible |
| Body Text | Hidden, replaced with word count summary |

Body text is condensed into placeholder blocks showing the word count:

```
{150 words hidden}
```

This allows you to see where content exists without being distracted by it.

## Reorganizing Your Document

One of Outline Mode's most powerful features is the ability to reorganize your document through drag and drop:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Outline Mode">
    Enable Outline Mode as described above.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify Drag Handles">
    Hover over the left side of any visible element to see the drag handle (⋮⋮).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag to Reposition">
    Click and hold the drag handle, then drag the element to a new position.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Release to Place">
    Release the mouse button to place the element in its new position.
  </Step>
</Steps>

When you drag an element, Esker automatically moves its associated content:

- Moving a heading also moves all content under that heading
- Child elements (like synopses) move with their parent elements
- Content order is preserved in both Outline Mode and regular editing mode

<Tip>
  Outline Mode is the fastest way to reorganize large sections of your document. Use it when you need to restructure chapters or rearrange scenes.
</Tip>

## Customizing Outline Mode

You can adjust how Outline Mode displays your content:

### Hiding Notes in Outline Mode

If you want a cleaner outline that focuses only on your document structure:

1. Click the menu button (☰)
2. Select **Options**
3. Check the **Hide Notes in Outline Mode** option
4. Click **Save Options**

This will hide all notes (@) when in Outline Mode, giving you a cleaner view that focuses only on your narrative structure.

## Using Outline Mode Effectively

Outline Mode is particularly useful for:

### Planning Your Document

Before writing detailed content:

1. Enter Outline Mode
2. Create headings to establish your structure
3. Add synopses to outline what will happen in each section
4. Use notes to record research or ideas
5. Reorganize sections as needed
6. Exit Outline Mode when ready to write

### Reviewing Your Structure

When revising your document:

1. Enter Outline Mode
2. Review the balance of your sections
3. Check synopses for plot consistency or logical flow
4. Identify sections that need expansion or reduction
5. Reorganize as needed
6. Exit Outline Mode to work on content

### Presenting to Others

When sharing your project plan:

1. Enter Outline Mode
2. Take screenshots or share your screen
3. Others can see your structure without being overwhelmed by details

## Exiting Outline Mode

To return to the regular editor view:

1. Click the menu button (☰)
2. Select **Disable Outline Mode**

Or simply press **F8** again to toggle off Outline Mode.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Can't drag elements | Make sure you're clicking directly on the drag handle (⋮⋮) |
| Notes still visible despite hiding option | Restart Outline Mode by toggling it off and on again |
| Can't see word count summaries | Make sure you have body text between your headings |
| Unable to edit text | Outline Mode is primarily for reorganizing, not editing. Exit Outline Mode for detailed editing |
