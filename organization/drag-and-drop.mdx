# Drag and Drop Reordering

Esker allows you to reorganize your document through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. This guide explains how to use this feature to effortlessly restructure your writing.

## Understanding Drag and Drop

Drag and drop in Esker lets you:

- Reorder chapters, scenes, and sections
- Move notes and bookmarks to new locations
- Reorganize your document structure visually
- Maintain proper relationships between elements

This feature is available in two primary locations:

1. **In the sidebar**: For quick reorganization while writing
2. **In Outline Mode**: For comprehensive document restructuring

## Drag and Drop in the Sidebar

The sidebar provides a quick way to reorganize your document:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Element">
    Find the heading, note, or bookmark you want to move in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click and Hold">
    Click and hold on the element you want to move.
    
    ![Click and hold an element](https://placeholder.img/drag-start.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag to New Position">
    While holding the mouse button down, drag the element to its new position.
    
    A blue line will appear indicating where the element will be placed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Release to Place">
    Release the mouse button to drop the element in its new position.
    
    The document will automatically update to reflect the new structure.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  When you drag an element in the sidebar, all related content in your document moves along with it. For example, moving a heading will also move all text and sub-headings beneath it.
</Note>

## Drag and Drop in Outline Mode

For more comprehensive reorganization, Outline Mode provides a powerful drag-and-drop interface:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Outline Mode">
    Click the menu button (☰) and select **Enable Outline Mode**, or press **F8**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate the Drag Handle">
    Hover over the left side of any element to reveal the drag handle (⋮⋮).
    
    ![Drag handle in Outline Mode](https://placeholder.img/outline-drag-handle.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click and Drag">
    Click and hold the drag handle, then drag the element to its new position.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Release to Place">
    Release to drop the element in its new position.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Outline Mode is particularly useful for major reorganization because it:
- Shows only structural elements (headings, synopses, notes, bookmarks)
- Hides body text to reduce clutter
- Clearly indicates parent-child relationships
- Provides visual feedback during drag operations

## How Drag and Drop Works

Understanding what happens when you move elements can help you reorganize more effectively:

### Moving Headings

When you drag a heading:

- The heading itself moves to the new position
- All content beneath the heading (text, synopses, notes) moves with it
- Any child headings and their content also move with it

For example, if you drag a Level 1 heading (#), all Level 2 (##) and Level 3 (###) headings nested under it will move along with all associated text.

### Moving Synopses, Notes, and Bookmarks

When you drag a synopsis, note, or bookmark:

- Only the selected element moves
- Related elements are not affected
- The document is updated to reflect the new position

### Nesting Rules

Esker maintains proper structural relationships during drag and drop:

- Level 1 headings (#) can be placed anywhere
- Level 2 headings (##) are always nested under the preceding Level 1 heading
- Level 3 headings (###) are always nested under the preceding Level 2 heading
- Synopses (=) are always associated with the heading they follow

## Best Practices for Reorganization

To get the most out of drag and drop:

### Plan Before Moving

- Review your document structure in Outline Mode before making major changes
- Consider how moving one section will affect others
- Identify sections that might need to be split or combined

### Use the Right Tool for the Job

- Use sidebar drag and drop for minor adjustments while writing
- Use Outline Mode for major restructuring
- Consider using keyboard navigation for precise placement

### Check Your Structure After Moving

- After reorganizing, review your document to ensure:
  - Headings are properly nested
  - Synopses are still with their correct headings
  - No content was accidentally moved or separated

## Advanced Drag and Drop Techniques

### Moving Multiple Levels at Once

To move an entire section with all its subsections:

1. Drag the highest-level heading (e.g., Level 1)
2. All nested content will move together as a unit

### Changing Heading Levels

Currently, drag and drop doesn't change the level of a heading. To change a heading's level (e.g., from Level 2 to Level 1):

1. Move the heading to the desired position using drag and drop
2. Edit the heading text to change the number of # symbols

### Moving Between Documents

Drag and drop works within a single document. To move content between documents:

1. Use copy (Ctrl+C/Cmd+C) and paste (Ctrl+V/Cmd+V)
2. Then use drag and drop to organize within the destination document

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Can't drag elements | Ensure you're clicking the element itself (in sidebar) or the drag handle (in Outline Mode) |
| Element doesn't drop where expected | Look for the blue indicator line showing the actual drop position |
| Heading doesn't take children | Make sure you're dragging the parent heading, not just a child element |
| Content appears out of order after drop | Check the heading levels to ensure proper nesting |
