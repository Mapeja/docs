# Using the Sidebar

The sidebar is one of Esker's most powerful features, automatically organizing your document structure as you write. This guide explains how to use the sidebar effectively to navigate and manage your writing.

## Sidebar Overview

The sidebar appears on the left side of the Esker interface and provides a structured view of your document:

The sidebar organizes your content into three main sections:

1. **Outline**: Shows your document structure (chapters, scenes, etc.)
2. **Notes**: Lists all notes (@) in your document
3. **Bookmarks**: Shows all bookmarks (!) for quick reference

## How the Sidebar Works

The sidebar automatically updates as you write in the editor. When you add headings, synopses, notes, or bookmarks, they instantly appear in the appropriate section of the sidebar.

Each type of content is formatted differently in the sidebar:

| Content Type | Sidebar Representation |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Level 1 Headings (#) | Bold text, no indentation |
| Level 2 Headings (##) | Regular text, slight indentation |
| Level 3 Headings (###) | Smaller text, more indentation |
| Synopses (=) | Italic text, indented under its heading |
| Notes (@) | Listed alphabetically in Notes section |
| Bookmarks (!) | Listed in order of appearance in Bookmarks section |

## Navigating with the Sidebar

The sidebar makes it easy to navigate through your document:

1. **Click any item** in the sidebar to instantly jump to that location in your document
2. **Scroll through the sidebar** to see your document's structure
3. **Use the quick access links** at the bottom of the sidebar to jump between sections

<Tip>
  When you click an item in the sidebar, Esker not only jumps to that location but also positions your cursor at the beginning of that element, ready for editing.
</Tip>

## Organizing Your Document with the Sidebar

The sidebar doesn't just display your document structure—it helps you organize it:

### Using the Outline Section

The outline section shows the hierarchical structure of your document:

- **Level 1 headings** (#) represent major divisions (like chapters)
- **Level 2 headings** (##) appear indented under their parent Level 1 heading
- **Level 3 headings** (###) appear indented under their parent Level 2 heading
- **Synopses** (=) appear under their associated heading with italic formatting

This hierarchical view helps you see your document's overall structure at a glance.

### Using the Notes Section

The Notes section collects all your research notes, reminders, and other non-narrative content:

- Notes are **sorted alphabetically** for easy reference
- Each note is listed with the text that follows the @ symbol
- Clicking a note jumps directly to that note in your document

<Tip>
  Consider using prefixes for your notes to group related information together (e.g., "@Character: Hero's background" and "@Character: Villain's motivation").
</Tip>

### Using the Bookmarks Section

The Bookmarks section helps you mark and quickly find important points:

- Bookmarks appear in the order they appear in your document
- Each bookmark is listed with the text that follows the ! symbol
- Clicking a bookmark jumps directly to that bookmark in your document

## Customizing the Sidebar

You can adjust the sidebar to suit your preferences:

### Resizing the Sidebar

To change the width of the sidebar:

1. Hover your cursor over the vertical divider between the sidebar and editor
2. When the cursor changes to a resize indicator, click and drag
3. Release when the sidebar is at your desired width

### Hiding and Showing the Sidebar

To toggle the sidebar visibility:

- Click the menu button (☰) and select **Toggle Sidebar**
- Use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+B** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+B** (Mac)

### Collapsing Sections

To focus on specific parts of your document structure:

1. Click on a section title (e.g., "Outline" or "Notes")
2. The section will collapse, hiding its contents
3. Click again to expand the section

## Advanced Sidebar Tips

### Truncating Sidebar Text with `::`

For cleaner sidebar navigation, use the `::` syntax to display shorter text in the sidebar:

```
# Chapter One: The Beginning of a Long and Winding Journey :: Chapter One
```

In this example, only "Chapter One" will appear in the sidebar, while the full title remains in your document.

### Quick Jump Navigation

At the bottom of the sidebar, you'll find quick access links to jump directly to different sections:

- Click **Outline** to jump to the top of your document structure
- Click **Notes** to jump to your collected notes
- Click **Bookmarks** to jump to your bookmarks

### Reordering with Drag and Drop

Esker's sidebar supports drag-and-drop reordering (see [Drag and Drop](/organization/drag-and-drop) for details):

1. Click and hold an item in the sidebar
2. Drag it to a new position
3. Release to move the content in your document

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Content not appearing in sidebar | Make sure you're using the correct syntax (e.g., # for headings) |
| Unable to click on sidebar items | Check if the sidebar is locked (look for a lock icon) |
| Sidebar too narrow/wide | Resize by dragging the divider between sidebar and editor |
| Can't see all sections | Scroll down in the sidebar or use the quick access links |
