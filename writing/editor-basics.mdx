# Editor Basics

Esker's editor is designed to provide a clean, distraction-free environment where you can focus on your writing. This guide covers the essential features of the editor and how to use them effectively.

## Editor Overview

The editor is the central area of Esker where you write your content:

It features:

- A clean, uncluttered writing space
- Automatic formatting as you type
- Seamless integration with the sidebar for navigation
- Word count and statistics tracking

## Starting to Write

To begin writing:

1. Click anywhere in the editor area to place your cursor
2. Start typing your content
3. Press **Enter** to create a new paragraph
4. Press **Shift+Enter** to create a line break within the same paragraph

As you write, Esker automatically formats your content based on the syntax you use (see [Writing Format](/writing/writing-format) for more details).

## Text Formatting

Esker automatically formats text as you type based on special characters at the beginning of lines:

| Prefix | Result | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `#` | Part/Major Heading | `# Chapter One` |
| `##` | Chapter/Subheading | `## The Beginning` |
| `###` | Scene/Minor Heading | `### Meanwhile...` |
| `=` | Synopsis | `= This scene introduces the protagonist` |
| `@` | Note | `@ Research needed for this section` |
| `!` | Bookmark | `! Important plot point` |

The editor will automatically apply appropriate styling to each type of content.

<Tip>
  You don't need to add formatting to every paragraph. Regular body text doesn't require any special prefix.
</Tip>

## Navigation Within the Editor

To navigate within your document:

- Use the **arrow keys** to move the cursor
- Use **Page Up** and **Page Down** to scroll through longer documents
- Use **Home** and **End** to move to the beginning or end of a line
- Use **Ctrl+Home** or **Ctrl+End** (Windows) / **Cmd+Home** or **Cmd+End** (Mac) to jump to the beginning or end of the document

You can also click directly on any part of your text to place the cursor at that position.

## Selecting Text

To select text for copying, cutting, or formatting:

- **Click and drag** with your mouse to select a range of text
- **Double-click** a word to select it
- **Triple-click** a paragraph to select the entire paragraph
- Use **Shift+Arrow keys** to extend selection from the cursor position

## Copy, Cut, and Paste

Esker supports standard text editing operations:

- **Ctrl+C** (Windows) / **Cmd+C** (Mac) to copy selected text
- **Ctrl+X** (Windows) / **Cmd+X** (Mac) to cut selected text
- **Ctrl+V** (Windows) / **Cmd+V** (Mac) to paste text at the cursor position

When pasting text into Esker, the editor will attempt to preserve the structure of your content by creating appropriate formatting.

## Undo and Redo

If you make a mistake or want to revert a change:

- **Ctrl+Z** (Windows) / **Cmd+Z** (Mac) to undo the last action
- **Ctrl+Y** or **Ctrl+Shift+Z** (Windows) / **Cmd+Shift+Z** (Mac) to redo

## Advanced Editor Features

Esker includes several advanced features to enhance your writing experience:

### Line and Paragraph Handling

- **Enter**: Creates a new paragraph
- **Shift+Enter**: Creates a line break within the same paragraph

### Empty Lines

To create empty lines for visual separation:

1. Place your cursor at the beginning of a line
2. Press **Enter** to create an empty line
3. Empty lines will be preserved in your document

### Handling Multiple Paragraphs

For body text across multiple paragraphs:

1. Type your content
2. Press **Enter** to start a new paragraph
3. Continue typing

Esker will maintain proper paragraph formatting automatically.

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Text not formatting correctly | Ensure you're using the correct syntax (e.g., `#` for headings) and that it's at the beginning of a line |
| Cursor placement problems | Click directly where you want to place the cursor or use arrow keys for precise positioning |
| Text disappearing after typing | Check if you accidentally entered a mode that hides body text (like Outline Mode) |
| Unable to create empty lines | Make sure you're pressing Enter at the beginning of a line |
