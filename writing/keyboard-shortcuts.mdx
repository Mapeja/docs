## Keyboard Shortcut Tips

Here are some tips for getting the most out of Esker's keyboard shortcuts:

### Learn Shortcuts in Stages

Don't try to memorize all shortcuts at once. Start with the basics:
1. First master file operations (`Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+O`)
2. Then focus on editing shortcuts (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+Z`)
3. Finally add navigation and special features

### Create Muscle Memory

The more you use keyboard shortcuts, the more automatic they become. Try to use a new shortcut 10 times in a row to help build muscle memory.

### Use Visual Cues

Many of Esker's menu items show the keyboard shortcut next to the action. Glance at these when opening menus to learn shortcuts naturally over time.
