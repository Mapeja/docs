# Writing Format

Esker uses a simple, markdown-inspired formatting syntax that helps you structure your document as you write. This guide covers how to use each formatting element effectively.

## Basic Formatting Elements

Esker recognizes special characters at the beginning of lines to format different types of content:

| Syntax | Function | Visual Style |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| `# Text` | Level 1 Heading (Chapter) | Large, bold font |
| `## Text` | Level 2 Heading (Scene) | Medium, bold font |
| `### Text` | Level 3 Heading (Sub-scene) | Small, bold font |
| `= Text` | Synopsis | Italic, indented |
| `@ Text` | Note | Standard text, different color |
| `! Text` | Bookmark | Bold text, highlighted |
| Regular Text | Body Text | Standard paragraph formatting |

Each formatting element serves a specific purpose in organizing your document.

## Headings: Structuring Your Document

Headings help organize your document into a hierarchical structure:

### Level 1 Headings (`#`)
```
# Chapter One
```

Level 1 headings are typically used for major divisions like chapters or parts of your document. They appear prominently in the sidebar for easy navigation.

### Level 2 Headings (`##`)
```
## The Unexpected Visitor
```

Level 2 headings work well for scenes or major sections within chapters.

### Level 3 Headings (`###`)
```
### Later That Evening
```

Level 3 headings are perfect for sub-scenes or smaller divisions within scenes.

<Tip>
  You can use any heading structure that works for your project. For example, a novelist might use Level 1 for parts, Level 2 for chapters, and Level 3 for scenes.
</Tip>

## Additional Content Elements

Beyond basic structure, Esker supports several special content types:

### Synopses (`=`)

Synopses provide brief summaries of sections:

```
= In this chapter, the protagonist discovers the hidden letter and begins to question everything.
```

Synopses appear in the sidebar under their associated heading, making it easy to track your story's development at a glance.

<Tip>
  Place synopses immediately after the heading they describe. This creates a clear association between the heading and its summary.
</Tip>

### Notes (`@`)

Notes are perfect for research, reminders, or commentary that isn't part of your main text:

```
@ Need to research Victorian table manners for this dinner scene.
```

Notes appear in a dedicated "Notes" section in the sidebar, making them easy to find later.

### Bookmarks (`!`)

Bookmarks help you mark important points in your document that you want to find quickly:

```
! Key turning point: protagonist makes the decision to leave
```

Bookmarks appear in their own section of the sidebar for quick reference.

## Using `::` for Sidebar Display

If you want a heading to display differently in the sidebar than in your document, use the `::` syntax:

```
# Chapter One: The Beginning of the End :: Chapter One
```

In this example, "Chapter One: The Beginning of the End" will appear in your document, but only "Chapter One" will show in the sidebar, keeping it clean and concise.

## Body Text

Any text that doesn't start with a formatting character is treated as regular body text:

```
This is a regular paragraph of body text. It doesn't require any special prefix.

This is another paragraph.
```

Body text is displayed in your document's default font and size.

## Empty Lines

To create empty lines for visual separation, simply press Enter on an empty line:

```
This is a paragraph.

[Empty line here]

This is another paragraph with space between.
```

Empty lines will be preserved in your document.

## Examples of Common Document Structures

### Novel Structure Example
```
# Chapter One
= The protagonist is introduced in their ordinary world.

John stared out the window, watching the rain trace patterns down the glass.

## The Phone Call
= A mysterious call disrupts John's quiet evening.

The shrill ring of the telephone broke the silence.

### The Decision
= John makes a choice that will change everything.

"I'll do it," he said, his voice surprisingly steady.

@ Research: Check if phones of this era would be described as "shrill" or if another term would be more period-appropriate.
```

### Research Document Example
```
# Literature Review
= Summary of existing research on the topic.

## Key Sources
= The most important papers and books in the field.

@ Remember to include the Thompson paper from 2018.

## Gaps in Research
= Areas where more study is needed.

! Potential thesis statement here
```

## Advanced Formatting Tips

- **Consecutive Headings**: You can place headings directly after one another if needed
- **Multiple Synopses**: You can add multiple synopses to a single heading
- **Organizing Notes**: Consider using a naming convention for notes (e.g., `@ Research:` or `@ TODO:`)
- **Mixed Content**: You can freely mix different content types throughout your document
