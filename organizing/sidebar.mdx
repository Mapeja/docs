# 📌 Organizing Your Writing with the Sidebar  

Esker’s **Sidebar** is the key to organizing your writing. It dynamically updates as you write, helping you **navigate, structure, and manage** your manuscript effortlessly.

## 🏗️ **Understanding the Sidebar**  

The Sidebar provides a structured view of your document, allowing you to:  

✅ **Quickly jump between sections** (headings, synopses, notes, and bookmarks).  
✅ **Reorder your manuscript** using drag-and-drop.  
✅ **Condense and expand elements** to keep your workspace clean.  

💡 **Tip:** The Sidebar updates in **real-time**, meaning you don’t need to manually organize sections!

## 📖 **Navigating with the Sidebar**  

You can click on any **heading, synopsis, note, or bookmark** in the Sidebar to instantly jump to that section.

- **Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)** – Represent major sections of your document.  
- **Synopses (`=`)** – Show brief summaries under each heading.  
- **Notes (`@`)** – Contain research, reminders, or background details.  
- **Bookmarks (`!`)** – Mark important sections for easy reference.  

💡 **Tip:** Use the `::` syntax to display a shorter version of a heading in the Sidebar:

```md
# Chapter One: The Beginning :: Chapter One
```

In this example, the Sidebar will only display **"Chapter One"**, keeping it clean while retaining full context in the document.

## 🔄 **Rearranging Sections with Drag & Drop**  

The Sidebar allows you to **reorder sections** using drag-and-drop:  

1. Click and hold a **heading** or **note** in the Sidebar.  
2. Drag it up or down to reposition it.  
3. Esker automatically moves all child elements (like synopses, notes, and body text) along with it.  

### **Drag & Drop Rules**  

🔹 Moving a **Heading 1 (`#`)** moves **everything beneath it** until the next Heading 1.  
🔹 Moving a **Heading 2 (`##`)** only moves its **subsections and content**.  
🔹 **Synopses and notes** are moved along with their parent section.  

## 🗂️ **Hiding and Expanding Elements**  

For a cleaner workspace, Esker allows you to **collapse or expand** sections in the Sidebar:  

- Click the **🔽 arrow** next to a heading to collapse or expand it.  
- **Outline Mode** condenses body text and non-narrative elements into a **single summary block**.  
- Toggle **Hide Notes in Sidebar** in **Settings** if you want a distraction-free view.
