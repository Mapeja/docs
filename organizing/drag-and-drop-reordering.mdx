# 🔀 Reordering Sections with Drag & Drop  

Esker allows you to **effortlessly restructure your manuscript** using **drag-and-drop** in the Sidebar. This feature makes it easy to reorganize chapters, scenes, and notes without manually copying and pasting content.

## 🎯 **How Drag & Drop Works**  

You can **reorder entire sections** by dragging them within the Sidebar. Esker automatically **moves all related content** to maintain structure.

### **Steps to Move Sections**  

1. **Click and hold** a section in the Sidebar.  
2. **Drag it up or down** to the desired position.  
3. **Drop** it where you want it to be.  
4. Esker will **automatically adjust** all child elements.  

💡 **Tip:** Dragging a **Heading 1 (`#`)** moves **everything beneath it** until the next Heading 1.

## 🏗️ **Understanding Section Movement**  

| Element Type | What Moves With It? |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Heading 1 (`#`)** | Everything until the next Heading 1 |
| **Heading 2 (`##`)** | All nested subsections and body text |
| **Heading 3 (`###`)** | Only its immediate content |
| **Synopses (`=`)** | Moves along with the associated heading |
| **Notes (`@`)** | Moves independently unless linked to a section |
| **Bookmarks (`!`)** | Remain fixed unless dragged separately |

### **Example Movement Scenarios**  

🔹 **Moving a Chapter (`#`)** → Moves all scenes, synopses, and notes inside it.  
🔹 **Moving a Scene (`##`)** → Moves its subsections but leaves the chapter intact.  
🔹 **Moving a Synopsis (`=`) or Note (`@`)** → Moves only the selected element.  

## 🛠️ **Fine-Tuning the Order of Elements**  

If an element **doesn’t move correctly**, try:  

✅ **Dragging the entire section from its heading** rather than its body text.  
✅ **Using the arrow keys** (`↑` and `↓`) for precise movements (coming soon).  
✅ **Manually adjusting within the editor** by cutting and pasting as a fallback.  

## 🔥 **Why Use Drag & Drop?**  

- **Quickly restructure your manuscript** without losing organization.  
- **Experiment with different story orders** to improve pacing.  
- **Easily reorder research notes and bookmarks** as your project evolves.
