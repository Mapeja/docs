## Feature Voting Tool Recommendation

Canny (https://canny.io) is our recommended tool for feature voting. It's:
- Easy to use for both users and administrators
- Allows for detailed feature requests with images and comments
- Provides clear status updates as features move through development
- Integrates with development tools like GitHub and Trello
- Has a free tier for small projects and reasonable pricing for growth

Other good options include:
- UserVoice (https://uservoice.com) - More enterprise-focused but very robust
- Frill (https://frill.co) - Simple and affordable
- Feature Upvote (https://featureupvote.com) - Straightforward with no per-user pricing

<Note>
  We've implemented Canny for Esker's feature voting, which you can access at [feedback.esker.app](https://feedback.esker.app).
