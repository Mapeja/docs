# 📖 Structuring a Novel in Esker  

Esker makes **outlining and structuring** your novel effortless. Whether you’re using a classic **three-act structure**, **Save the Cat beat sheet**, or a **custom approach**, Esker keeps everything organized in a single file.

## 📌 **Choosing a Novel Structure**  

Esker supports multiple outlining methods:  

✅ **Three-Act Structure** – Traditional novel structure (Beginning, Middle, End).  
✅ **Save the Cat Beat Sheet** – Ideal for pacing your story beats.  
✅ **Hero’s Journey** – Classic storytelling template for fantasy and adventure.  
✅ **Custom Structures** – Use Esker’s headings to create your own approach.  

### **Setting Up Your Outline**  
1. Click **☰ Menu** → **New Project**.  
2. Select a **Story Template** (e.g., Three-Act Structure).  
3. Esker will pre-fill your document with an outline.  

💡 **Tip:** Use `#`, `##`, and `###` to organize your novel by chapters, scenes, and subsections.

## 🏗️ **Example Novel Outline in Esker**  

```md
# Act One: The Setup
= Introduce the protagonist, setting, and inciting incident.

## Chapter One: The Beginning

## Chapter Two: The Inciting Incident
= The event that changes everything.

# Act Two: The Conflict
## Chapter Five: The Midpoint

💡 **Tip:** Add **synopses (`=`)** under each chapter heading to summarize key events.
