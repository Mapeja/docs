# 📚 Using Esker for Non-Fiction & Research  

Esker isn’t just for novelists—it’s a **powerful tool for non-fiction writers, researchers, and content creators**.  

## 🏗️ **Structuring Non-Fiction Books**  

Instead of chapters and scenes, you might use:  

✅ **Main Sections (`#`)** – Book parts or main topics.  
✅ **Subsections (`##`)** – Individual chapters or case studies.  
✅ **Notes (`@`)** – Research, citations, and external references.  

### **Example Non-Fiction Outline**  

```md
# Part One: Introduction
= The purpose and scope of the book.

## Chapter One: Defining the Problem
= Introduce key concepts.

@ Reference: Harvard Study on Productivity (2021)
```

💡 **Tip:** Use `@` notes to store **citations, references, and footnotes**.

## 🔍 **Research Organization in Esker**  

Esker helps manage research by allowing you to:  

- Store **source notes & citations** in one place.  
- Use **bookmarks (`!`)** for quick access to key insights.  
- Export **structured drafts** without including research notes.
