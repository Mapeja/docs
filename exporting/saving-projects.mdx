# Saving Projects

Esker uses a straightforward approach to saving your work, with projects stored as `.esker` files that contain all your content, including structure, notes, and settings. This guide explains how to save, manage, and protect your writing.

## Understanding Esker Files

Esker stores your projects as `.esker` files, which:

- Contain all your writing in a single file
- Include project metadata like title, author, and goals
- Use a plain text format for reliability and future accessibility
- Can be backed up and transferred between devices

<Note>
  Esker files are plain text files, meaning your work is never locked in a proprietary format. You can open an `.esker` file in any text editor if needed, ensuring your writing is always accessible.
</Note>

## Saving Your Work

### Saving a New Project

When you create a new project, Esker will prompt you to save it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Project">
    After filling in the project details and clicking "Create Project," a save dialog will appear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Location">
    Select a location on your computer where you want to save the file.
    
    ![Save Dialog](https://placeholder.img/save-dialog.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your File">
    The filename will default to your project title, but you can change it if desired.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the Save">
    Click "Save" to create the file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Saving Changes

As you work on your project, save your changes regularly:

- **Manual Save**: Press **Ctrl+S** (Windows) or **Cmd+S** (Mac) to save at any time
- **Menu Save**: Click the menu button (☰) and select **Save**

<Tip>
  Even though Esker offers autosave features, it's good practice to manually save your work after completing significant sections or making important changes.
</Tip>

### Save As (Creating a Copy)

To create a copy of your project with a different name:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Save As Dialog">
    Click the menu button (☰) and select **Save As**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Location and Name">
    Select a location and enter a new filename for your copy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the Save">
    Click "Save" to create the copy.
    
    Your current working file will switch to the new copy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Save As is particularly useful for:
- Creating version backups (e.g., "NovelDraft2.esker")
- Starting variations of your project
- Making milestone copies (e.g., "Novel-Chapter10Complete.esker")

## Opening Existing Projects

To return to a previously saved project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Open Dialog">
    Click the menu button (☰) and select **Open Project**.
    
    Alternatively, use **Ctrl+O** (Windows) or **Cmd+O** (Mac).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate Your File">
    Navigate to where your `.esker` file is saved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select and Open">
    Select the file and click "Open" to load the project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Opening a project replaces the current content in the editor. Make sure to save any unsaved changes to your current project before opening a different one.
</Warning>

## Project Management Best Practices

### File Organization

Develop a consistent system for organizing your Esker files:

- Create a dedicated folder for all your writing projects
- Use descriptive filenames that include the project title and version
- Consider using subfolders for different types of projects or series

Example folder structure:
```
My Writing/
├── Novels/
│   ├── SciFiNovel.esker
│   └── MysteryNovel-Draft2.esker
├── Short Stories/
│   ├── SummerTale.esker
│   └── WinterStory-Final.esker
└── Blog Posts/
    └── WritingTips.esker
```

### Regular Backups

Protect your work with regular backups:

1. Save copies to an external drive periodically
2. Use cloud storage (like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive) to store copies
3. Consider email backups by sending important versions to yourself
4. Enable Esker's automatic backup feature (see [Autosave & Backups](/exporting/autosave-backups))

<Tip>
  The 3-2-1 backup strategy is recommended: maintain 3 copies of your work, on 2 different types of storage, with 1 copy offsite (like in cloud storage).
</Tip>

### Version Management

For longer projects, consider maintaining multiple versions:

- Use descriptive suffixes (e.g., "-rough-draft", "-revision1", "-final")
- Include dates in filenames for clearer versioning (e.g., "Novel-2023-05-20.esker")
- Save milestone versions after completing significant sections

## Advanced Project Management

### File Properties

Esker stores project metadata in the file itself. To view and edit these properties:

1. Click the menu button (☰) and select **Project Settings**
2. Review or update project details (title, author, goals, etc.)
3. Click "Save Settings" to update the file properties

### Moving Projects Between Devices

To work on your project on a different computer:

1. Save your project on the original device
2. Transfer the `.esker` file via:
   - Cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
   - USB drive
   - Email attachment
3. Open the file on the new device using Esker

<Note>
  Since all your work is contained in a single file, transferring projects between devices is straightforward—just move the `.esker` file.
</Note>

### Recovering Unsaved Changes

If Esker closes unexpectedly, it attempts to recover your work:

1. Reopen Esker
2. If recovery data is available, Esker will prompt you to restore the unsaved changes
3. Choose whether to restore the recovered content
4. Save immediately after recovery

For additional recovery options, see [Autosave & Backups](/exporting/autosave-backups).

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Cannot save file" error | Check if you have write permissions for the selected location |
| File appears empty after saving | Try using "Open Project" to reload the file; check storage for corruption |
| Can't find saved file | Use your operating system's search function to locate `.esker` files |
| "File in use" error | Make sure the file isn't open in another application |
| Losing changes despite saving | Check if you're editing the correct file; verify save operations are completing |
