# Exporting Formats

Esker allows you to export your writing in multiple formats to accommodate different needs, whether you're sharing with readers, submitting to publishers, or collaborating with editors. This guide covers all the export options and when to use each one.

## Export Types Overview

| Export Type | Description | Best For |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Full Draft | Includes everything exactly as written | Complete archives, personal reference |
| Structured Draft | Organizes content into notes and draft sections | Collaboration with editors, revision process |
| Manuscript | Only includes headings and body text | Submission to publishers, sharing with readers |
| Outline | Only includes headings and synopses | Planning, reviewing structure |
| Notes | Only includes research notes | Reference, collaboration on research |

## File Formats

Esker supports multiple file formats for export:

### Plain Text (.txt)

- Preserves full Esker syntax (headings, synopses, notes)
- Maximum compatibility with any device or application
- Ideal for backups or when you need to access content in other text editors

### Markdown (.md)

- Converts Esker syntax to standard markdown formatting
- Works with markdown editors and preview tools
- Great for sharing with technically-minded collaborators
- Supported by many blogging platforms and documentation systems

### Rich Text Format (.rtf)

- Includes basic formatting like font styles and alignment
- Compatible with most word processors
- Good for sharing with editors who need minimal formatting

### Microsoft Word (.docx)

- Industry-standard format with comprehensive formatting
- Perfect for submissions requiring a professional document
- Compatible with Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and other word processors

### PDF (.pdf)

- Fixed layout that looks identical on all devices
- Ideal for final distribution or formal submission
- Cannot be easily edited by recipients

## Export Types in Detail

### Full Draft Export

Full Draft exports include everything in your document exactly as written:

```
# Chapter One
= This is a synopsis of the chapter

This is body text for the chapter.

@ This is a note about research needed.
```

This export type:
- Preserves all content types (headings, synopses, notes, bookmarks)
- Maintains the original document structure
- Keeps all your planning elements alongside your content

<Tip>
  Use Full Draft exports for personal backups or when you want to edit your document in another application while preserving all Esker-specific formatting.
</Tip>

### Structured Draft Export

Structured Draft exports reorganize your content into two main sections:

```
# Notes
@ Research point 1
@ Research point 2

# Draft
## Chapter One
This is body text for the chapter.
```

This export type:
- Places all notes at the beginning of the document
- Groups narrative content (headings and body text) in a separate section
- Makes it easier for collaborators to distinguish between your research/notes and actual content

<Tip>
  Structured Draft exports are perfect for sharing with editors or beta readers who need to see your notes but want them clearly separated from the main content.
</Tip>

### Manuscript Export

Manuscript exports include only the content that would appear in a published work:

```
# Chapter One

This is body text for the chapter.
```

This export type:
- Includes only headings and body text
- Removes all notes, synopses, and bookmarks
- Creates a clean document suitable for submission

<Tip>
  Use Manuscript exports when submitting to publishers, agents, or sharing with readers who should only see the final content.
</Tip>

### Outline Export

Outline exports focus on the structure of your document:

```
# Chapter One
= This is a synopsis of the chapter

## Scene One
= This is a synopsis of the scene
```

This export type:
- Includes only headings and their associated synopses
- Removes all body text, notes, and bookmarks
- Creates a concise document showing your project's structure

<Tip>
  Outline exports are ideal for reviewing your story structure, planning revisions, or sharing your document plan with collaborators without revealing all the content.
</Tip>

### Notes Export

Notes exports compile all your research and notes:

```
@ Character: Protagonist's backstory
@ Research: Historical context for Chapter 3
@ Todo: Revise the climactic scene
```

This export type:
- Includes only note elements (@)
- Organizes notes alphabetically
- Creates a reference document of your research and planning

<Tip>
  Notes exports are perfect for creating a research companion document or sharing just your research findings with collaborators.
</Tip>

## Advanced Export Options

For formats that support more advanced formatting (RTF, DOCX, PDF), Esker provides additional options:

### Text Formatting

- **Font**: Choose between serif, sans-serif, or monospaced fonts
- **Font Size**: Select the base font size for your document
- **Line Spacing**: Set the line spacing (single, 1.5, or double)

### Margins

- **Top/Bottom/Left/Right**: Adjust margins to meet specific requirements
- Presets for common standards (academic, publishing, etc.)

### Page Formatting

- **Title Page**: Include a professional title page with your name and contact info
- **Headers**: Add headers with title, name, and page numbers
- **Page Breaks**: Automatically insert page breaks between sections

<Note>
  These advanced formatting options are available for RTF, DOCX, and PDF exports but not for TXT or MD formats, which focus on content rather than presentation.
</Note>

## Export Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Format

Consider your audience when selecting an export format:

| Recipient | Recommended Format |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Publishers/Agents | DOCX or PDF |
| Editors | DOCX or RTF |
| Beta Readers | PDF or DOCX |
| Writing Group | DOCX or PDF |
| Personal Backup | TXT or MD |

### File Naming Conventions

Use consistent, descriptive filenames for your exports:

```
[Title]-[Type]-[Version]-[Date].docx
```

Example: `MyNovel-Manuscript-Draft2-2023-05-15.docx`

### Pre-Export Checklist

Before exporting important documents:

1. Save your Esker project
2. Run a spell check or review for obvious errors
3. Check that all sections are properly formatted
4. Ensure headings follow a consistent pattern
5. Review any notes that might need to be removed for certain export types

## Batch Exporting

For comprehensive backups or submissions, consider creating multiple export types at once:

1. Export a Manuscript for submission
2. Export an Outline for your own reference
3. Export a Full Draft for complete archival

This approach ensures you have appropriate formats for different uses.

## Export Templates

For recurring export needs, Esker allows you to save export settings as templates:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Export Settings">
    Set up all your preferred export options in the Export dialog.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save as Template">
    Click the "Save as Template" button and provide a name.
    
    ![Save Export Template](https://placeholder.img/save-export-template.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Template">
    For future exports, select your template from the dropdown menu to apply all saved settings instantly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This feature is particularly useful if you regularly export with specific formatting requirements.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Formatting lost in export | Check that you're using a format that supports formatting (DOCX, RTF, PDF) |
| File too large | Consider using a different format or splitting into multiple exports |
| Incorrect line spacing | Adjust line spacing in the export settings before exporting |
| Notes appearing in Manuscript | Double-check that you selected "Manuscript" export type, not "Full Draft" |
| Special characters corrupted | Try a different format or check encoding settings in the target application |
