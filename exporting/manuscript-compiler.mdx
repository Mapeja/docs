# Manuscript Compiler

Esker's Manuscript Compiler transforms your writing into a professionally formatted manuscript that meets industry standards for submission to agents, editors, and publishers. This powerful tool gives you extensive control over how your final document appears while maintaining consistent, submission-ready formatting.

## What is the Manuscript Compiler?

The Manuscript Compiler is a specialized export tool that goes beyond basic exporting by:

- Creating properly formatted title pages
- Applying consistent, industry-standard formatting
- Converting your structural elements (headings) into appropriate chapter and section formats
- Adding professional headers with page numbers
- Including optional front and back matter
- Generating a clean PDF ready for submission

Unlike basic exports, the Manuscript Compiler focuses on creating documents that adhere to publishing industry expectations.

## Manuscript Structure Settings

The compiler offers granular control over how your document's structure is interpreted:

### Heading Level Definitions

You can define how each heading level is treated in your manuscript:

| Heading Level | Common Usage | Options |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Level 1 (#) | Major divisions | Part, Chapter, Scene, or None |
| Level 2 (##) | Chapters or sections | Part, Chapter, Scene, or None |
| Level 3 (###) | Scenes or subsections | Part, Chapter, Scene, or None |

<Tip>
  For a typical novel, you might set Level 1 (#) as "Part," Level 2 (##) as "Chapter," and Level 3 (###) as "Scene."
</Tip>

### Heading Formatting

For each structural element, you can customize how it appears:

#### Parts

Options for formatting parts:
- **Show as Written**: Uses the exact text from your headings
- **Part Word**: Displays "Part One," "Part Two," etc.
- **Part Roman**: Displays "Part I," "Part II," etc.
- **Part Arabic**: Displays "Part 1," "Part 2," etc.
- **Number Only**: Displays just "1," "2," etc.
- **Roman Only**: Displays just "I," "II," etc.

You can also choose whether to display the original heading title after the part number.

#### Chapters

Options for formatting chapters:
- **Show as Written**: Uses the exact text from your headings
- **Chapter Word**: Displays "Chapter One," "Chapter Two," etc.
- **Chapter Arabic**: Displays "Chapter 1," "Chapter 2," etc.
- **Number Only**: Displays just "1," "2," etc.

As with parts, you can choose whether to display the original heading title after the chapter number.

#### Scenes

Options for scene breaks:
- **Show as Written**: Uses the exact text from your headings
- **Asterisk**: Uses "***" to indicate scene breaks
- **Hash**: Uses "#" to indicate scene breaks
- **Blank Line**: Uses an empty line to separate scenes
- **None**: No visible scene separator

## Front and Back Matter

The Manuscript Compiler allows you to include standard book elements:

### Front Matter Options

- **Dedication**: A personal message dedicating your work
- **Preface**: An introduction written by you
- **Introduction**: An explanatory section about the work
- **Epigraph**: A quote or poem at the beginning
- **Prelude**: A short opening scene setting the stage
- **Prologue**: An opening section providing background

### Back Matter Options

- **Epilogue**: A closing section that wraps up the story
- **Afterword**: Your thoughts on writing the work
- **Acknowledgments**: Thanks to those who helped

For each of these elements, you can:
1. Enable it in the compiler settings
2. Select which heading from your manuscript contains the content
3. Choose how it should be formatted in the final document

<Note>
  When selecting headings for special book parts, the compiler will show a list of all headings in your document, making it easy to assign the right content to each section.
</Note>

## Manuscript Formatting Options

For quick setup, the compiler offers an "Industry Standard Manuscript Format" option which:

- Uses 12pt Times New Roman font
- Sets double-spaced lines
- Creates 1-inch margins all around

This is the recommended format for most submissions to agents and publishers.

## Using the Manuscript Compiler Effectively

### Best Practices

Follow these guidelines for the best results:

1. **Review Your Structure First**: Make sure your headings are consistent and properly formatted
2. **Check Special Sections**: If using front or back matter, ensure the corresponding headings are properly identified
3. **Preview Formatting**: Use the industry standard setting as a starting point
4. **Be Consistent**: Choose heading level definitions that match how you've structured your document
5. **Save Settings**: If you plan to make multiple submissions, keep your settings consistent

## Advanced Techniques

### Creating Multiple Manuscript Versions

The compiler can be used to create different versions of your manuscript:

- **Standard Version**: Using industry-standard formatting for general submissions
- **Custom Version**: With specific formatting required by particular publishers
- **Reader-Friendly Version**: With more generous spacing and margins for beta readers

Simply adjust the compiler settings for each version and export separately.

### Handling Special Cases

#### Anthologies or Collections

For short story collections or anthologies:

1. Use Level 1 headings (#) for story titles
2. Use Level 2 headings (##) for sections within stories
3. Configure the compiler to treat Level 1 as "Chapter" formatting

#### Academic or Technical Works

For technical documents:

1. Use consistent heading levels for chapters, sections, and subsections
2. Enable appropriate front matter like Introduction
3. Adjust line spacing according to the style guide you're following (e.g., APA, MLA)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Headings not formatting correctly | Check heading level definitions in compiler settings |
| Front matter not appearing | Verify you've selected the correct heading in your document |
| Headers missing | Check header settings and ensure they're enabled |
| Unexpected page breaks | Review page break settings for parts and chapters |
| Text appearing too compressed | Increase line spacing or adjust margins |
| PDF file size too large | Consider using a different font or simplifying formatting |
