# ðŸ“œ Markdown Export  

Markdown is a **lightweight, portable text format** used for blogs, content creation, and importing into other writing platforms. Esker allows you to **export your project as Markdown** while preserving its structure.

## ðŸ”„ **Why Use Markdown?**  

âœ… **Cross-Platform Compatibility** â€“ Works with tools like Obsidian, WordPress, and static site generators.  
âœ… **Lightweight & Portable** â€“ No complex formatting, just structured text.  
âœ… **Future-Proof** â€“ Easily converted into HTML, PDF, or other formats.  

## ðŸ“– **How to Export as Markdown**  

1. Click **â˜° Menu** â†’ **Export** â†’ **Export as Markdown**.  
2. Choose between:  
   - **Full Draft Export** â€“ Includes all text, notes, and synopses.  
   - **Structured Draft Export** â€“ Exports only the manuscript, omitting notes.  
3. Click **Save**, and choose a location for the exported `.md` file.  

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Esker **preserves heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`)**, making your document easy to navigate in Markdown editors.

## ðŸ“œ **Whatâ€™s Included in Markdown Export?**  

| Element Type | Markdown Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Headings (`#`)** | Converted directly as `# Chapter` |
| **Synopses (`=`)** | Exported as italicized text (`*Synopsis*`) |
| **Notes (`@`)** | Included in Full Draft but omitted in Structured Draft |
| **Bookmarks (`!`)** | Removed from Markdown export |

### **Example Markdown Export**  

Your Esker project:

```md
# Chapter One
= This chapter introduces the protagonist.

## Scene One
This is the body text.
@ This is a private note.
```

Will be exported as:

```md
# Chapter One
*This chapter introduces the protagonist.*

## Scene One
This is the body text.
```

**Notes (`@`) are removed in Structured Draft exports.**

## ðŸ”¥ **Best Practices for Markdown Export**
