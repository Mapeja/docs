# 🐞 Reporting Bugs & Feature Requests  

Esker is constantly evolving, and we rely on user feedback to make improvements. If you encounter a **bug** or have an idea for a **new feature**, here’s how to report it effectively.

## 🛠️ **How to Report a Bug**  

If Esker isn’t working as expected, reporting the issue helps us fix it faster.  

### **Steps to Report a Bug**  
1. **Check if the bug has already been reported**  
   - Visit the **[Esker Community](https://discord.gg/eskerapp)** or **Esker GitHub Issues**.  
   - If the issue already exists, add a comment instead of creating a duplicate report.  

2. **Gather necessary details**  
   - What were you doing when the bug occurred?  
   - What is the **expected behavior** vs. what actually happened?  
   - Are there **error messages**?  

3. **Submit the bug report**  
   - **Via Discord:** Post the issue in the `#bug-reports` channel.  
   - **Via GitHub Issues:**  
     1. Go to **[Esker GitHub Issues](https://github.com/eskerapp/issues)**.  
     2. Click **New Issue** → **Bug Report**.  
     3. Fill in the details and submit.  

💡 **Tip:** Screenshots or video recordings **help us diagnose issues faster**!

## 💡 **Requesting a New Feature**
