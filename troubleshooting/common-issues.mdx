# 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues  

If you're experiencing issues with Esker, don’t worry! This guide covers **common problems and their solutions**, so you can get back to writing as quickly as possible.

## ❌ **Esker Won’t Open a Project File**  

### **Possible Causes & Fixes:**  
🔹 **File was moved or renamed** – Esker relies on the `.esker` project file. If it was moved:  
   - Locate it using your system’s **File Explorer**.  
   - Open Esker and click **☰ Menu → Open Project** to manually locate it.  

🔹 **File is corrupted** – If Esker crashes while saving:  
   - Check for a **backup** version: `YourProject_backup.esker`.  
   - If found, open it instead of the original file.  

🔹 **Using an incompatible file type** – Esker **only supports `.esker` files**. If trying to open another format:  
   - Import text manually by opening it in another editor and copying the content into Esker.

## 💾 **Recovering Lost Work**  

### **Autosave Recovery:**  
1. Open Esker.  
2. If an **autosave version** exists, a **Restore Prompt** appears.  
3. Click **Restore** to load the latest autosaved draft.  

### **Backup Recovery:**  
1. Open **Esker**.  
2. Click **☰ Menu** → **Open Project**.  
3. Navigate to your backup folder and select the most recent version (`YourProject_backup.esker`).  

💡 **Tip:** Enable **autosave and backups** in settings to prevent future data loss.

## 🐌 **Esker is Running Slowly or Freezing**  

🔹 **Too many open applications** – Close unnecessary apps to free system resources.  
🔹 **Large project files** – If your document exceeds **100,000 words**, performance may slow down.  
   - Split your manuscript into separate `.esker` files and manage them individually.  
🔹 **Hardware limitations** – If you’re on an older computer:  
   - Reduce editor width (`☰ Menu → Options → Editor Width → Narrow`).  
   - Disable animations (`☰ Menu → Options → Performance Mode`).  

## 🎨 **Dark Mode or Theme Changes Not Applying**  

🔹 **Restart Esker** after applying new themes.  
🔹 **Clear cached preferences**:  
   - Click **☰ Menu → Options → Reset Preferences**.  
   - Restart Esker and reapply your desired theme.  

## 🔊 **Typing Sounds Not Playing**  

🔹 Ensure **Typing Sounds** are enabled in **☰ Menu → Options → Typing Sounds**.  
🔹 Check **your system volume and audio output settings**.  
🔹 If using **Bluetooth headphones**, reconnect them and restart Esker.  

## 📂 **Can’t Find My Recent Projects**  

🔹 Click **☰ Menu → Recent Projects** to check if they appear.  
🔹 If missing, manually locate the `.esker` files and **open them manually**.  

## 🔥 **Best Practices to Avoid Issues**  

✅ **Enable Autosave & Backups** – Prevents data loss from crashes.  
✅ **Use Save As** – Create multiple copies for major drafts.  
✅ **Restart Esker** – Fixes minor bugs after updates or theme changes.  
✅ **Keep Esker Updated** – Install the latest version to ensure optimal performance.
