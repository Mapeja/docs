  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click "Save Options" to apply your layout choices.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editor Width

One of the most impactful layout settings is the editor width, which affects how your text is displayed:

### Setting Editor Width

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Options">
    Navigate to the Editor section in the Options dialog.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Width Value">
    Specify your desired editor width in one of these formats:
    - Percentage (e.g., "50%") - relative to the window width
    - Pixels (e.g., "700px") - fixed width regardless of window size
    - Characters (e.g., "80ch") - width based on character count
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Preset Width Options

For quick adjustments, you can use the preset width buttons:
- **Narrow (30%)**: Creates a compact writing column
- **Regular (60%)**: Provides a balanced width for most writing
- **Wide (90%)**: Utilizes most of the available screen space

<Tip>
  Many professional writers prefer a narrower column width (60% or less) as it improves readability and helps maintain focus on the current paragraph.
</Tip>

### Optimal Width Considerations

Research on readability suggests:
- **45-75 characters per line** is optimal for reading comfort
- **60-65 characters** is ideal for most readers
- Wider lines can cause eye fatigue during extended reading

Consider your typical writing style when choosing a width:
- Narrower widths (30-50%) for creative writing and focused work
- Medium widths (50-70%) for general writing and balanced viewing
- Wider widths (70-90%) for technical writing or comparative editing

## Typography Settings

Customize how text appears with typography adjustments:

### Font Size

Choose the base font size for the editor:
- **Tiny (0.75rem)**: Displays more text on screen at once
- **Small (0.875rem)**: Compact but readable
- **Regular (1rem)**: Standard size for most users
- **Large (1.125rem)**: Enhanced readability
- **Enormous (1.5rem)**: Maximum readability, fewer words on screen

### Line Height

Adjust the spacing between lines of text:
- **Single (1)**: Minimal spacing, compact display
- **Regular (1.2)**: Standard spacing for balanced readability
- **1.5**: Enhanced spacing for improved readability
- **Double (2)**: Maximum spacing for drafting or editing

### Letter Spacing

Fine-tune the spacing between individual characters:
- **Narrow (-0.05em)**: Tighter character spacing
- **Regular (0)**: Standard spacing
- **Wide (0.05em)**: Increased spacing between characters

<Note>
  Typography settings affect both the editor and the sidebar, ensuring a consistent visual experience throughout the application.
</Note>

## Sidebar Customization

The sidebar, which displays your document structure, can also be customized:

### Sidebar Width

Adjust how much screen space the sidebar occupies:
1. Hover your cursor over the divider between the sidebar and editor
2. When the cursor changes to a resize indicator, click and drag
3. Release when the sidebar is at your desired width

### Visibility Toggle

You can hide the sidebar completely for a distraction-free experience:
- Click the menu button (☰) and select **Hide Sidebar**
- Use keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+B** (Windows) or **Cmd+B** (Mac)
- Click the same option (now labeled **Show Sidebar**) to bring it back

### Section Collapse

Within the sidebar, you can collapse individual sections:
1. Click on a section title (e.g., "Outline" or "Notes")
2. The section will collapse, hiding its contents
3. Click again to expand the section

## Statistics Bar Customization

The statistics bar at the bottom of the screen can be toggled on or off:

### Visibility Toggle

- Click the menu button (☰) and select **Hide Statistics**
- Click the same option (now labeled **Show Statistics**) to restore it
- Use keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+W** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+W** (Mac)

<Tip>
  Hiding the statistics bar is useful when you want to focus on writing without being concerned about word count or other metrics.
</Tip>

## Full Layout Scenarios

Esker provides several quick-access layout scenarios:

### Fullscreen Mode

For maximum screen space:
- Click the menu button (☰) and select **Enter Fullscreen**
- Use keyboard shortcut **F11** (Windows) or **Cmd+Ctrl+F** (Mac)

## Advanced Layout Tips

### Layout Preferences for Different Devices

Consider using different layouts based on your device:
- **Desktop/Larger Screens**: Wider editor, visible sidebar
- **Laptop/Smaller Screens**: Narrower editor, hidden sidebar when writing
- **External Monitor**: Use fullscreen mode for maximum immersion

### Combined Layout & Font Settings

For optimal readability, coordinate your layout with font settings:
- Narrower editor width pairs well with larger font sizes
- Wider editor width often works better with smaller font sizes
- Adjust line height based on editor width (higher line height for wider columns)

### Layout Transitions

Develop a workflow that leverages different layouts:
1. Start with planning layout to organize thoughts
2. Switch to drafting layout for writing
3. Transition to editing layout for revision
4. Return to planning layout for structural adjustments

## Layout and Productivity

Your layout choices can significantly impact your writing productivity:

### Finding Your Optimal Layout

Each writer has different preferences. Experiment with various layouts to discover what works best for you:
- Try different editor widths for a week each
- Toggle the sidebar on and off during different writing phases
- Test how font size affects your writing speed and comfort

### Environmental Considerations

Adjust your layout based on:
- **Lighting conditions**: Darker themes for low light, lighter themes for bright environments
- **Session length**: More generous spacing for longer sessions to reduce eye strain
- **Screen size**: Scale your layout appropriately for your display

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Layout settings not saving | Make sure you click "Save Options" after making changes |
| Text appears cut off | Try increasing editor width or reducing font size |
| Sidebar takes up too much space | Resize by dragging the divider between sidebar and editor |
| Can't find the statistics bar | Make sure it's enabled via menu (☰ → Show Statistics) |
