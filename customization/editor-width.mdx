# 📏 Editor Width & Layout Adjustments  

Esker allows you to **adjust the width of the writing area** to suit your workflow. Whether you prefer a narrow, focused writing space or a wide, spacious layout, Esker provides multiple customization options.

## 🖥️ **Adjusting the Editor Width**  

You can modify the width of the editor to enhance readability and comfort.  

### **How to Change Editor Width**  
1. Click **☰ Menu** → **Options** → **Editor Width**.  
2. Select one of the available options:  
   - 📐 **Narrow (30%)** – Best for distraction-free, focused writing.  
   - 📝 **Regular (60%)** – A balanced width for most writers.  
   - 🖥️ **Wide (90%)** – Maximizes screen real estate for large monitors.  
3. Click **Apply** to save changes.  

💡 **Tip:** A **narrow editor** simulates the **classic typewriter feel**, keeping your focus on the active text.

## 📜 **Using Fullscreen Mode**  

For a **completely distraction-free environment**, enable **Fullscreen Mode**.  

### **How to Toggle Fullscreen Mode**  
- Click **☰ Menu** → **Enter Fullscreen**.  
- Or press **F11** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + Ctrl + F** (Mac).  
- To exit fullscreen, press **Esc** or the same shortcut again.  

🔹 **Removes UI distractions**, allowing you to focus on writing.  
🔹 Works well with **Typewriter Mode** for immersive writing.  

## 🔁 **Toggle Sidebar Visibility**  

For additional customization, you can **show or hide the Sidebar**:  

1. Click **☰ Menu** → **Toggle Sidebar**.  
2. Or use **Ctrl + B** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + B** (Mac).  
3. The Sidebar will collapse, giving you more screen space.  

💡 **Tip:** Hiding the Sidebar is useful in **editing mode** when you only need to focus on the text.

## 🎯 **Best Practices for Layout Optimization**  

✅ **Use Narrow Width + Typewriter Mode** for **deep focus**.  
✅ **Combine Fullscreen Mode with Dark Theme** for **minimal eye strain**.
