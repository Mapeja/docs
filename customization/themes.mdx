## Theme Details

### Esker Light (Default)

The default Esker Light theme features:
- White background with black text
- Subtle gray accents
- Blue highlights for interactive elements
- Clear visual hierarchy for different content types

This theme provides maximum readability in well-lit environments and is similar to traditional word processors.

### Esker Dark

The Esker Dark theme offers:
- Dark gray background with light text
- Reduced brightness to minimize eye strain
- Warmer accent colors to reduce blue light
- Maintained contrast for readable text

This theme is ideal for night writing or low-light environments, and may help reduce eye fatigue during extended writing sessions.

### Vintage Green

Inspired by early computer terminals, this theme features:
- Black background with monochrome green text
- Different shades of green for various elements
- Minimal color distractions
- Nostalgic, focused writing environment

Many writers find the monochrome approach helps maintain focus on the words themselves.

### Vintage Amber

Similar to Vintage Green but with a warmer color palette:
- Black background with amber/orange text
- Reduced blue light emission
- High contrast for readability
- Warm color tone that may be easier on the eyes in the evening

The amber color is particularly good for night writing as it minimizes blue light exposure that can affect sleep patterns.

## Theme Benefits

Choosing the right theme can significantly impact your writing experience:

### Reducing Eye Strain

Dark themes (Esker Dark, Vintage Green, Vintage Amber) can reduce eye strain in several ways:
- Lower overall brightness
- Reduced contrast between elements
- Minimized blue light emission
- Less pupil dilation in low-light environments

### Improving Focus

Certain themes can help with concentration:
- Monochrome themes reduce color distractions
- Dark themes minimize the perception of surrounding space
- Consistent color schemes require less visual adjustment

### Adapting to Environment

Switching themes based on your environment optimizes visibility:
- Use light themes in bright rooms or outdoors
- Switch to dark themes in dim lighting or at night
- Adjust based on screen type (e-ink, LCD, OLED)

<Tip>
  For writing sessions that span from day into evening, consider starting with Esker Light and switching to Esker Dark as natural light diminishes.

## Theme Impact on Writing Element Display

Different themes change how various document elements appear:

| Element | Light Theme | Dark Theme | Vintage Themes |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| Headings | Bold black text | Bold white text | Bright green/amber |
| Body Text | Dark gray | Light gray | Standard green/amber |
| Synopses | Italic blue | Italic light blue | Dimmer green/amber, italic |
| Notes | Purple text | Light purple text | Distinct green/amber shade |
| Bookmarks | Orange highlight | Gold highlight | Brightest green/amber |
| Sidebar | Light gray | Dark gray | Black with green/amber text |

These visual differences help maintain the distinction between content types while adapting to the theme's overall aesthetic.

## Theme Considerations

When selecting a theme, consider these factors:

### Screen Type

Different screens display themes differently:
- **LCD Screens**: Light themes often work well in bright environments
- **OLED Screens**: Dark themes can save battery and reduce eye strain
- **E-ink Displays**: High-contrast themes provide the best readability

### Lighting Conditions

Your environment affects which theme works best:
- **Bright Daylight**: Light themes maintain contrast and readability
- **Office Lighting**: Either light or dark themes work well
- **Evening/Night**: Dark themes reduce glare and eye strain

### Personal Preference

Some theme considerations are subjective:
- Color sensitivity or preferences
- Associations with different color schemes
- Visual processing differences

Try different themes to see which one allows you to write most comfortably for extended periods.

## Combining Themes with Other Features

Themes work well with other Esker features to enhance your writing environment:

### Themes + Focus Mode

Different themes create different focus experiences:
- Dark themes with Focus Mode create a highly immersive environment
- Light themes with Focus Mode maintain readability while reducing distractions

### Themes + Typewriter Sounds

For a complete sensory experience:
- Pair Vintage Green theme with IBM keyboard sounds for a retro computing feel
- Match Esker Dark with modern mechanical keyboard sounds for a contemporary setup

### Themes + Customized Editor Width

Adjust both visual theme and content width:
- Narrow columns with dark themes for maximum focus
- Wider columns with light themes for better content overview

## Advanced Theme Tips

### Optimal Theme Schedules

Consider changing themes based on time of day:
- Morning: Light theme for energy and alertness
- Afternoon: Light or dark based on preference
- Evening: Switch to dark theme to reduce blue light before sleep

### Theme-Based Writing Sessions

Some writers use different themes for different types of work:
- Light theme for editing and revision (analytical work)
- Dark theme for creative first drafts (generative work)
- Vintage themes for distraction-free deep work

### Seasonal Adjustments

Adapt your theme use to seasonal changes:
- Winter (shorter days): More time using dark themes
- Summer (longer days): More time with light themes

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Theme not saving between sessions | Verify Options are saved correctly |
| Poor contrast in certain theme | Try adjusting your screen brightness |
| Eye strain despite using dark theme | Consider adjusting room lighting as well |
| Theme looks different than expected | Check monitor calibration or night mode settings |
| Font appears too small/large with certain themes | Adjust font size in Options independently of theme |
